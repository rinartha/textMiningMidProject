https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803721,LeBron tops career scoring record as Lakers fall to Thunder,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — LeBron James became the NBA’s career scoring leader on a stepback jumper late in the third quarter, passing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s record during his 38-point performance in the Los Angeles Lakers’ 133-130 loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder on Tuesday night.

            James surpassed the mark held since April 1984 by Abdul-Jabbar, who watched the game from a baseline seat near the Lakers’ bench. Abdul-Jabbar then joined an emotional James and NBA Commissioner Adam Silver on the court after the historic basket.

            James scored 20 points in the first half with a full showcase of the offensive talent that still shines blindingly after two decades in the NBA, and he tore through the record in a 16-point third quarter capped by that pretty jumper.











            The game was stopped for about 10 minutes while James hugged his family and participated in a brief ceremony with Silver and Abdul-Jabbar.

            Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 30 points and Jalen Williams had 25 for the Thunder, who moved 1 1/2 games ahead of the 13th-place Lakers near the bottom of the Western Conference standings.

            Anthony Davis managed just 13 points for the Lakers, and the Thunder never trailed in the second half. James scored only two points in the fourth quarter, putting him atop the career scoring list with 38,390 points.

            SUNS 116, NETS 112

            NEW YORK (AP) — Deandre Ayton matched his career high with 35 points, Devin Booker scored 19 in his first game since Christmas and Phoenix held off Cam Thomas and Brooklyn.

            The 21-year-old Thomas led a late charge and finished with 43 points, becoming the youngest player in NBA history with three straight 40-point games. He had 44 and a career-high 47 points in his previous two games.

            Mikal Bridges had 17 of his 21 points in the second half and played a key role in the defensive effort that cooled off Thomas just long enough for the Suns to build a 12-point lead with 2:25 remaining. 

            Booker missed the previous 21 games with a strained left groin.

            Thomas rallied the Nets mostly from the free-throw line, and his intentional miss with 4.1 seconds remaining left the Suns with a 114-112 lead. He then fouled Ayton, who finished it off with two free throws after going 14 for 18 from the field and grabbing 15 rebounds.

            DENVER (AP) — Nikola Jokic posted his 19th triple-double of the season by halftime and Denver rode a 49-point first quarter to a rout of Minnesota.

            Jokic finished with 20 points, 16 assists and 12 rebounds. It was the second time in his career the big man has notched a triple-double by halftime. Jokic took a seat late in the third quarter.

            Denver led 49-19 after the first quarter as the Nuggets shot 79.2% from the floor. The 49 points tied for the second-most in a quarter in the franchise’s NBA history. Michael Porter Jr. led the way by scoring 19 of his 30 points in the opening period.

            Aaron Gordon added 24 for the Nuggets, who set season highs in points and assists (44).

            Anthony Edwards and Luka Garza both had 19 points for Minnesota.

            ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — Jalen Brunson scored 25 points and made the go-ahead basket with 1:13 left, Julius Randle had 22 points and 14 rebounds, and New York beat Orlando.

            Brunson’s running bank shot put the Knicks up for good at 94-93. He then fed Jericho Sims for a dunk and a three-point lead.

            The teams combined to shoot 10 free throw attempts in the final 7.7 seconds. The only miss was by Orlando’s Paolo Banchero, who intentionally tried to set up a tying basket with 2.3 seconds remaining.

            Markelle Fultz led the Magic with 21 points. Franz Wagner added 18 points and Banchero finished with 16 points after being held to four in the first half.

            The Pelicans led 111-95 when Trey Murphy III hit his fourth 3-pointer of the game with 3:24 to go. Atlanta responded with a 7-0 run, but New Orleans held on.

            Bogdan Bogdanovic scored 22 points for Atlanta and Dejounte Murray scored 19. Trae Young had 16 points and 16 assists.

            GRIZZLIES 104, BULLS 89

            MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) — Ja Morant scored 34 points, Jaren Jackson Jr. added 24 points and five blocks, and Memphis rallied in the fourth quarter to beat Chicago.

            Desmond Bane finished with 17 points and Brandon Clarke had 13 points and 13 rebounds for the Grizzlies, who stopped a three-game skid.

            Nikola Vucevic had 28 points and 17 rebounds for the Bulls, whose three-game winning streak ended. Chicago played without leading scorer DeMar DeRozan because of right hip soreness.

            Zach LaVine scored 24 points for Chicago.

            Foegele, a fourth-round winger, had his first two-goal game of the season one game after he was a healthy scratch.

            “It’s one of the best games I’ve seen from him, and he should feel real good about himself,"" Oilers coach Jay Woodcroft said. “There’s nobody more happy for him than his teammates and his coaching staff.”











            Fourth-line center Ryan McLeod and Foegele had goals 36 seconds apart early in the second and Foegele scored again midway through the period to give the Oilers a 3-1 lead. Third-line center Ryan Nugent-Hopkins restored their two-goal lead late in the third period.

            “We got some contributions from our entire lineup, which is great,"" said Edmonton's Evander Kane, who had an empty net goal. “We’re going to need that as we go down the stretch here and obviously in the playoffs. That type of scoring wins or loses you series.”

            Edmonton's Jack Campbell stopped 30 shots, including some key ones in the third to keep a one-goal lead.

            “They were big saves, but I would say Jack expects to make those days and we expect those saves,"" Woodcroft said. “He’s starting to build a little personal momentum for himself.”

            The Oilers maintained the momentum they had going into the All-Star break with their eighth win in nine games.

            “The boys have been playing great leading up to the break and definitely wanted to continue where we left off,"" Campbell said. “Great way to start the road trip and get all the juices flowing again.”

            Ville Husso made 22 saves for the Red Wings, who had won two of their previous three games.

            “There are a lot of positives to take out of this game despite the score, but we just didn’t finish,"" Detroit coach Derek Lalonde said.

            Detroit's Tyler Bertuzzi broke a scoreless tie midway through the first period and Joe Veleno scored with 9 seconds left in the second to pull the home team within a goal.

            Edmonton, the NHL's highest-scoring team and best on the power play, scored with an extra skater when Nugent-Hopkins had a goal with 4:22 left in the third.

Third-line center Ryan Nugent-Hopkins restored their two-goal lead late in the third period.“We got some contributions from our entire lineup, which is great,"" said Edmonton's Evander Kane, who had an empty net goal. “We’re going to need that as we go down the stretch here and obviously in the playoffs.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803726,Biden speech takeaways: More conciliation than conflict,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The State of the Union address tends to have a ritual rhythm. Grand entrance. Applause. Platitudes. Policies. Appeals for Unity, real or imagined.

            
                President Joe Biden checked those boxes, and a few more, during his speech to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday night. In part, he seemed to be laying the foundation to run for a second term. “We've been sent here to finish the job,” he said.

            Biden made calls for unity and tried to emphasize conciliation over conflict, easier to do in this rarefied setting, seemingly impossible to sustain in such divided times.











            Takeaways from the prime-time address:

            MORE CONCILIATION THAN CONFLICT

            Biden's speech almost defiantly ignored the bitter divisions between Republicans and Democrats and his own low standing with the public. 

            He returned repeatedly to common ground, making the case that both parties can back U.S. factories, new businesses being formed and the funding of 20,000 infrastructure projects. When Biden hit each of these themes, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., politely clapped. He even stood to applaud at one point.

            It’s a sign that Democrats and Republicans can at least agree to a shared set of goals, even if they have very different views of how to get there.

            In the midterm election campaign, Biden warned of Republican extremists. On Tuesday night, he portrayed them as partners in governance during the first two years of his presidency.

            But then came a Biden comment that generated boos and hoots from Republicans: Biden said some in the GOP were bent on cutting Social Security and Medicare.

            That sparked a raucous back and forth that seemed more in line with the reality of the actual relationship between the parties.

            ___

            REGULAR JOE

            Biden used the speech to highlight his focus on the common man, calling out billionaires who pay lower tax rates than does the middle class, and airlines that treat their passengers like “suckers.”

            It amounted to a dare to Republican lawmakers who increasingly claim to represent blue-collar workers.

            “No billionaire should pay a lower tax rate than a school teacher or a firefighter,” Biden said in one of the bigger applause lines of his speech.

            The president brought back an idea from last year to put a minimum tax on billionaires so they don’t pay a lower rate than many middle-class households. Biden had pitched a 20% tax on the income and unrealized financial gains of households worth $100 million or more. The administration estimated it would generate $360 billion over 10 years. That would in theory help fund some priorities and possibly reduce the deficit.

            But Biden’s tax plan might be more about scoring political points. He couldn’t get it past Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., in the Senate last year.

            The president was straightforward in saying he would stop airlines from charging fees in order to sit families together, saying that children were being treated like luggage. He wants to ban hidden resort fees charged by hotels and penalties charged by cell service providers.

            “Americans are tired of being played for suckers,” Biden said.

            ___

            PASSING OVER CHINA BALLOON 

            Biden had been on a winning streak countering China, America's rising military and economic competitor.

            Then Beijing brazenly floated a spy balloon across the United States, an embarrassing episode for Biden that culminated last weekend with him ordering the Pentagon to shoot the craft out of the sky over the Atlantic Ocean.

            The incident has dominated headlines, with some Republicans arguing that it demonstrates Biden has been wobbly on Beijing.

            Biden briefly addressed the incident directly: “As we made clear last week, if China’s threatens our sovereignty, we will act to protect our country. And we did.”

            Lost in the noise is the administration’s increasingly aggressive efforts to push back against China, through agreements with the Philippines and Japan to adjust or expand the U.S. military presence in those countries.

            The balloon drama overshadowed all of that.

            ___

            STANDING WITH UKRAINE

            
                Last year’s State of the Union was dramatically shaped by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which started days before the address.

            At that moment, the chances of Ukraine staying in the fight with a more formidable Russian military seemed highly unlikely. Nearly a year later, Ukraine is firmly in the fight.

            Biden took a moment to pay tribute to Ukraine, addressing one of his guests, Ambassador Oksana Markarova, as representing “not just her nation but the courage of her people.”

            He also applauded Congress for giving the Ukrainian what it needed to face Russia’s brutal aggression; the United States has already committed nearly $30 billion in security assistance since the start of the war.

            In private, administration officials have made clear to Ukrainian officials that Congress’ patience with the cost of the war will have its limits. But with Tuesday’s address, Biden offered an optimistic outlook about the prospects of long-term American support.

            “Ambassador, America is united in our support for your country,” Biden said looking toward Markarova in the gallery. “We will stand with you as long as it takes.”

            ___

            FEELING THEIR PAIN

            Among Biden’s guests were the parents of Tyre Nichols, the 29-year-old Black man whose beating death at the hands of Memphis, Tennessee, police has reignited a national debate on policing.

            Efforts to reduce police excesses have been sharply restricted by resistance in Congress, and there’s little prospect of federal action.

            Still, Biden expressed awe at the grace of Nichols’ mother, RowVaughn Wells, who following his death has talked of her son’s “beautiful soul” and hopeful certainty that “something good will come from this.”

            Biden, 80, also acknowledged in plain terms that as a white man he’s enjoyed a privilege that Nichols’ parents — and Black parents writ large — do not.

            “Imagine having to worry whether your son or daughter will come home from walking down the street or playing in the park or just driving their car,” he said. “I’ve never had to have ‘the talk’ with my children — Beau, Hunter and Ashley — that so many Black and brown families have had with their children.”

            ___

            FINISH THE JOB

            Biden uttered the phrase “finish the job” at least a dozen times during his address. It sounded like the makings of a slogan he might employ for a reelection campaign. 

            But it is highly unlikely he will be able to finish the job on many of the things he referenced, like an assault weapons ban, universal preschool for 3- and 4-year-olds and forcing companies to stop doing stock buybacks.

            The loss ended Tampa Bay's 12-game winning streak at home, a franchise record. The Lightning dropped to 20-1-0 when leading after the first period and 20-5-1 at home overall.

            Meier scored the winner from in close off a pass from All-Star defenseman Erik Karlsson. It is Meier's third 30-goal season.











            “I felt we did a good job changing and kind of holding onto the pucks,” Meier said. “(Karlsson) did what he does best, finding guys backdoor, and I just had to tap it in.”

            San Jose also got goals from Karlsson and Jonah Gadjovich. Kaapo Kahkonen stopped 34 shots. 

            Karlsson's two assists gave him 52 this season to go with 17 goals.

            The Sharks improved to 4-11 in overtime and shootouts.

            Brayden Point had two goals and Ross Colton also scored for the Lightning, who lost 7-1 at Florida on Monday night. Brian Elliott made 18 saves.

            Tampa Bay took 81 shots — 37 on goal, 27 that were blocked and 17 that missed the net. 

            San Jose totaled 40 shot attempts.

            “When you’re kind of having your way in the game for the first half of it, and all of sudden you’re letting the other team hang around, this is the National Hockey League man, the other team is trying, too,” Lightning coach Jon Cooper said. “Even though they might be outside the playoff spot, they’re all fighting for jobs and they’re trying to win, too.""

            Nikita Kucherov had two assists and tops the NHL with 55. The right wing tied his franchise record (2018-19) with a point in 16 consecutive home games.

            San Jose’s 30th-ranked power play went 2 for 3. The Lightning’s third overall unit was 1 of 6.

            Gadjovich tied it 3-all at 3:08 of the third period. Meier scored his 13th power-play goal to make it 3-2 with 3:37 left in the second.

            “We adjusted,” Meier said. “I thought the first 30 minutes of the game looked like we were a little rusty out there, but we found a way to battle back. I felt we played real determined."" 

            It was San Jose's first game since the All-Star break. The Sharks last played on Jan. 28, a 6-4 win at Pittsburgh.

            Point hit the post with a backhand after a rush from his own blue line with eight minutes remaining in the third. Meier hit the crossbar on a breakaway with a minute left.

            Tampa Bay appeared to regain a two-goal lead 38 seconds after Meier's first goal, but Steven Stamkos’ goal was overturned on replay after a San Jose challenge. 

            Point, who lost an assist on the play and hit the post earlier in the second, fought Michael Eyssimont with 20 seconds to go in the period.

            Stamkos was held without a point on his 33rd birthday.

            Point gave Tampa Bay a 3-1 lead on his second consecutive goal with 3:16 left in the first.

            After Eyssimont took a holding penalty in the offensive zone, Point reached the 30-goal mark for the third time during the ensuing man advantage at 9:21.

            Point and Meier are the 10th and 11th NHL players to reach 30 goals this season, the most at this stage of a season since 1996-97.

            Colton opened the scoring 2:10 into the game before Karlsson tied it with a power-play goal at 6:28 of the first.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803730,"Ayton has 35, Suns hold off Thomas, Nets in Booker's return","NEW YORK (AP) — These aren't the Phoenix Suns that fell apart after Devin Booker was hurt. 

            The team he came back to is surging and doesn't expect that to change.

            “We're going to have this thing rolling now,” Deandre Ayton said. “Suns basketball on the way for sure.”











            Ayton matched his career high with 35 points, Booker scored 19 in his first game since Christmas and the Suns held off Cam Thomas and the Brooklyn Nets 116-112 on Tuesday night.

            Booker missed 21 games with left groin strain. The Suns had a stretch of nine losses in 10 games early in his absence but hung in well at the end and have won nine of 11.

            “Now we're back and we have our guy back, so he knows we're locked and loaded,” Ayton said. 

            The 21-year-old Thomas led a late charge and finished with 43 points, becoming the youngest player in NBA history with three straight 40-point games. He had 44 and a career-high 47 points in his previous two games, but the Nets are 1-2 during Thomas' run.

            “Obviously I’d rather have the win because it sounds better when you have these 40-point games with the two (games) that we lost, but it’s just good to have my name in history,” Thomas said. 

            Mikal Bridges had 17 of his 21 points in the second half and played a key role in the defensive effort that cooled off Thomas just long enough for the Suns to use a 13-4 run to build a 109-97 lead with 2:25 remaining.

            Booker scored six points and set up Ayton for another basket during that stretch.

            “That’s all I want right there is just competition and being back out there with the band and just feeling that energy, feeling that presence,” Booker said. “The team has it rolling right now, so just insert myself in a way that wasn’t disruptive and try to keep the flow that they have.” 

            Thomas rallied the Nets mostly from the free-throw line, and his intentional miss with 4.1 seconds remaining left the Suns with a 114-112 lead. He then fouled Ayton, who finished it off with two free throws after going 14 for 18 from the field and grabbing 15 rebounds. 

            Nic Claxton and T.J. Warren had 17 points each for the Nets, who lost on back-to-back nights after trading Kyrie Irving and fell to 5-9 without the injured Kevin Durant. They opted not to play Spencer Dinwiddie and Dorian Finney-Smith, the players they acquired from Dallas in the trade for Irving.

            Ben Simmons had two points and six assists after missing five games with left knee soreness. 

            TIP-INS

            Suns: Chris Paul surpassed 2,500 steals, a mark reached by only John Stockton, Jason Kidd and Michael Jordan. He had nine points and 12 assists. 

            Nets: Brooklyn was also without Seth Curry (left adductor strain) and Yuta Watanabe (back tightness). ... Coach Jacque Vaughn said Durant continues to progress well in his recovery but still hasn't been involved in the any portions of practice where there is contact. Vaughn said he didn't know when Durant would take that step, and he won't play before he does. The Nets only have four games remaining before the All-Star break. 

            DINWIDDIE AND DORIAN

            Dinwiddie spent five seasons with the Nets and recalled when he signed a multiyear deal in December 2016 after coming into the league as a second-round pick who battled to prove he was more than a G League player.

            “My career’s been hard, and that right there kind of solidified knowing, like, my family’s going to be fine,” Dinwiddie said.

            He said there was nostalgia being back in Brooklyn, where he averaged a career-best 20.6 points in 2019-20, and praised Finney-Smith's ability to be an important contributor to the team.

            “Understanding that we may not be the best trade package, but we are the best-looking and the Nets needed some help in that department,” he joked. 

            ANOTHER TRADE

            The Nets dealt forward Kessler Edwards to Sacramento for the rights to 2016 second-round pick David Michineau and cash. Edwards began last season on a two-way deal before playing well enough to earn a standard NBA contract, but had appeared in just 14 games this season.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803731,"Ingram scores 30, Pelicans down Hawks for 3rd straight win","NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Brandon Ingram scored 30 points, CJ McCollum added 21 and the New Orleans Pelicans defeated the Atlanta Hawks 116-107 on Tuesday night for their third straight victory. 

            “Brandon, it's a difference when he's on the floor. He’s one of the best players in the game and we’re seeing it over and over,” Pelicans coach Willie Green said. “He’s starting to find his rhythm and when he does, he’s a tough cover.”

            Ingram has played in five games since sitting out about two months with a left big toe injury. He's scored at least 30 in each of his past two games, both Pelicans victories.











            “I'm able to get my legs under me a little bit and figure out different things,"" Ingram said. ""I’m able to score the basketball, but I’m also able to look for the best shot on the floor.”

            Ingram “sets the table for his teammates,"" Green said, mentioning Ingram's eight assists. ""He’s doing a great job of getting to space and then attacking, getting to the paint, getting to the free-throw line, pulling up for his mid-range shots.”

            Jonas Valanciunas, returning from a one-game absence because of a sore right quadriceps muscle, had 16 points and 14 rebounds for New Orleans.

            “They won the hustle game,” Hawks coach Nate McMillan said. “Every loose ball, every long rebound, it seemed like they got and we just seemed to be a step slow throughout the night.”

            The Pelicans led 111-95 when Trey Murphy III hit his fourth 3-pointer of the game with 3:24 to go.

            Atlanta responded with seven straight points to cut the Pelicans' lead to nine with 1:49 left. Ingram briefly broke up the run with a driving layup in traffic. But John Collins hit a turnaround and Trae Young hit a 3 from 29 feet to make it a two-possession game with 43 seconds left. 

            Atlanta then fouled Herb Jones, who hit two free throws and then blocked Bogdan Bogdanovic's 3-pointer to help the Pelicans hold on. 

            “I knew they wanted to get 3,” said Jones, who finished with 11 points, nine rebounds and three steals. “When I saw him going to his shot, I just did what I always do.”

            Murphy scored 16 points for the Pelicans, whose current winning streak has come on the heels of a 10-game skid.

            “We’re learning that we have the ability to navigate adversity,” Green said. ""We do it together. We stay connected. We don’t point fingers and we just grind it out.”

            Bogdanovic scored 22 points for Atlanta. Dejounte Murray, who played despite being listed as questionable with a migraine earlier in the day, scored 19. 

            “This is a tough team, a tough place to win,” Bogdanovic said. “They’re finding their groove back and now they’re different than a couple games ago.

            “I’m proud of the way we fight. We found the energy to fight,"" Bogdanovic added. ""I’m not happy the way we finished the road trip.”

            Young had 16 points and 16 assists, and Collins finished with 15 points.

            Atlanta missed its first six shots and trailed 12-2 before recovering to tie the game at 23 on Young's 3-pointer late in the first quarter.

            The game remained close for the rest of the half, and the Pelicans led 62-59 at halftime after McCollum hit a 3-pointers on consecutive possessions.

            TIP-INS

            Hawks: Closed out their road trip at 2-3. ... Had 30 assists, giving them at least 25 in five straight games, the team's longest such streak this season. ... De'Andre Hunter, who came in having scored at least 10 points in 16 straight, had three points.

            Pelicans: All-Star forward Zion Williamson (right hamstring) missed his 19th straight game. Green said Williamson continued to be “day to day” and that it was unclear whether he would play before the All-Star break. ... Outscored Atlanta in the paint, 56-40. ... Converted 13 offensive rebounds into 22 second-chance points.

            LUCKY SHOT?

            McCollum made an off-balance, double-pump 3 as the shot clock ran out in the fourth quarter.

            “In this game, you need a little luck to win,” Ingram said. “Of course, he's a good 3-point shooter, but I don't think we would imagine that one going in.”

            Added Murphy: “Yeah, I haven't seen him practice that one.”

(AP) — Ja Morant scored 34 points, Jaren Jackson Jr. added 24 points and five blocks, and the Memphis Grizzlies rallied in the fourth quarter to beat the Chicago Bulls 104-89 on Tuesday night.

            Desmond Bane finished with 17 points and Brandon Clarke had 13 points and 13 rebounds for the Grizzlies, who stopped a three-game skid. Clarke had seven of the team's 11 rebounds in the key fourth.

            “This was an important game to go get because we kind of battled back in that fourth quarter,” Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said.











            Unlike recent losses when Memphis couldn’t close out games, the Grizzlies were solid down the stretch, outscoring the Bulls 32-14 in the fourth — including a 10-0 run.

            “These recent games we've been giving up too many layups and stuff at the rim. Second-chance points,” Morant said. “We were back to pretty much our defense late and able to execute on the other end.”

            Nikola Vucevic had 28 points and 17 rebounds for the Bulls, whose three-game winning streak ended. Chicago played without leading scorer DeMar DeRozan because of right hip soreness.

            Zach LaVine scored 24 points for Chicago and Ayo Dosunmu added 14 points and six assists.

            But poor shooting hindered the Bulls at the start of the game and in the final period. Chicago was 5 of 19 from the field in the fourth, including making only one of its 10 3-point attempts.

            “I thought we did some good things in the fourth quarter,” Bulls coach Billy Donovan said. “I didn't think we shot the ball particularly well from the 3 or from the field. ... I think we lost a little bit of rhythm.”

            The Bulls trailed 49-39 at halftime, plagued by 13 turnovers and 30% shooting, including 3 of 16 from 3-point range. But Chicago got rolling in the third behind Vucevic, who had 14 points in the quarter, and LaVine, who contributed 12. The Bulls led 75-72 entering the fourth.

            “I think execution-wise, we came down and weren't really organized,” LaVine said. ""We had a lot of opportunities to make shots. We just didn't knock them down.

            “It was a low-scoring game on both ends. We just didn't get enough stops.”

            For Memphis, it was a reprieve from its recent troubles where it had lost eight of the last nine. But Jackson said it is a matter of maintaining a balanced mindset through the slumps.

            “There is no time to get excited or feel bad about a win or a loss,” Jackson said. “The greatest teams never did that. Teams that aren't great, do that.”

            TIP-INS

            Bulls: G Alex Caruso, who missed the previous two games with mid-foot soreness, started in DeRozan's spot and recorded his 750th career assist in the first quarter. ... The Bulls totaled 14 points in both the first and fourth quarters, their lowest for any quarter this season. ... Vucevic has 34 games this season with at least 10 rebounds.

            Matt Duchene scored for Nashville in the first period. Juuse Saros, Nashville’s lone representative at the All-Star Game, made 25 saves.

            The Predators had won three straight and five of six going into the All-Star break.

            “We weren’t good in a lot of facets and there’s no excuses for it,” Nashville coach John Hynes said. “The other team had a break too, and tonight it wasn’t good.”

            Hill faced just four shots in the first and two in the second. Nashville’s previous low for shots in a game this season was 18, and Vegas’ previous season low for shots allowed was also 18.

            “That game was kind of weird in the sense that it wasn’t like they had no zone time,"" Hill said. “There were pucks missing the net, hitting bodies in front, so I was able to stay in it pretty easily. It wasn’t like there were any long stretches of play where I didn’t have any action in my end.”

            Duchene’s 15th goal put Nashville in front at 5:04, but Vegas responded with three goals in the first.

            “We didn’t deserve to win tonight,” Duchene said. “We beat ourselves more than they beat us. That’s kind of the story.”

            Amadio and Carrier scored 27 seconds apart, and Kessel made it 3-1 at 11:58. 

            “It was a good response to keep the game tight, and (we) came out of that first period with a 3-1 lead is good for us,” Carrier said.

            SHOT SUPPRESSION

            Nashville narrowly avoided a couple of franchise records for fewest shots on goal. The two shots that made it through to Hill in the middle frame exceeded the Predators record for shots in a period by one. They registered just one shot on goal on four occasions, the most recent coming on Dec. 8, 2008.

            The franchise record for fewest shots on goal during a game is nine, set Jan. 27, 2001. 

            SUCCESS AGAINST NASHVILLE

            Stephenson has two goals and three assists in two games against Nashville this season. In 10 career games against the Predators, he has six goals and eight assists. 

            WHITECLOUD BACK

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803746,"In State of the Union speech, Biden challenges Republicans on debt and economy","President Joe Biden challenged Republicans to lift the U.S. debt ceiling and support tax policies that were friendlier to middle class Americans on Tuesday in a State of the Union speech that served as a blueprint for his 2024 re-election campaign.Assailing oil companies for making high profits and corporate America for taking advantage of consumers, Biden used his prime time speech to outline progressive priorities of his Democratic Party that are anathema to many Republican lawmakers.Making his first address to a joint session of Congress since Republicans took control of the House of Representatives in January, Biden pledged to work with opposition lawmakers even as he sparred with them in the chamber.""To my Republican friends, if we could work together in the last Congress, there is no reason we can’t work together and find consensus on important things in this Congress as well,"" he said.Some Republicans heckled and jeered him at times during a speech that lasted some 73 minutes.Biden took them on, challenging Republicans to raise the $31.4 trillion debt ceiling, which must be lifted in the coming months to avoid a default. The White House has said Biden will not negotiate over that necessity; Republicans want spending cuts in exchange for their support.""Some of my Republican friends want to take the economy hostage - I get it - unless I agree to their economic plans. All of you at home should know what those plans are. Instead of making the wealthy pay their fair share, some Republicans ... want Medicare and Social Security to sunset,"" he said, drawing boos.He then urged lawmakers to stand up for senior citizens, which they did, prompting Biden to claim victory. ""I enjoy conversion,"" he quipped, suggesting such cuts to the social safety net programs popular with voters were now off the table.The back and forth underscored Biden's apparent comfort in Congress, where he engaged in debates as a U.S. senator for 36 years.""Joe Biden sparring with the crowd and winning wasn’t something I expected,"" said former Representative Adam Kinzinger, a Republican, on Twitter.The president called for reforms in policing after Tyre Nichols, a Black man, died last month after being beaten by officers in Memphis, Tennessee. Nichols' mother and stepfather were among the guests at the speech.Highlighting topics that could feature prominently in a re-election campaign, Biden said the economy was benefiting from 12 million new jobs, COVID-19 no longer controls American lives, and U.S. democracy remains intact despite facing its biggest threat since the Civil War.""Today, though bruised, our democracy remains unbowed and unbroken,"" he said.As a candidate in 2020 and at his inauguration in 2021, shortly after the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, Biden said he wanted to unify the country. And he stuck to that theme, highlighting a massive infrastructure bill and ribbing Republican lawmakers who opposed it.""I want to thank my Republican friends who voted for the law,"" he said. ""My Republican friends who voted against it ... I still get asked to fund the projects in those districts as well, but don’t worry, I promised I'd be a president for all Americans.""POLL PROBLEMSDespite his efforts, Biden remains unpopular.His public approval rating edged one percentage point higher to 41% in a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll that closed on Sunday. That is close to the lowest level of his presidency, with 65% of Americans saying they believe the country is on the wrong track, compared to 58% a year earlier.Similarly, in the autumn of 2020, when Donald Trump was president, 65% of registered voters believed the country was on the wrong track, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling.Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who once served as press secretary for Trump, rejected Biden's upbeat vision of the country in her Republican response to his address.“In the radical left’s America, Washington taxes you and lights your hard-earned money on fire. But you get crushed with high gas prices, empty grocery shelves, and our children are taught to hate one another on account of their race,” Sanders said in her televised remarks.Biden aides see the speech as a milestone ahead of the second presidential campaign he is expected to launch in coming weeks.Biden turned 80 in November and, if re-elected, would be 82 at the start of a second term, a fact that concerns many Democratic voters, recent polls show.DIVIDED REPUBLICANSBiden faced a splintered gathering of Republican lawmakers, eager to put their conservative mark on U.S. policy following four years of Democratic control of the House.Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a Republican who has faced challenges unifying lawmakers from his party, sat behind Biden during the address for the first time. “Mr. Speaker, I don’t want to ruin your reputation, but I look forward to working with you,"" Biden said, drawing laughs.McCarthy and Vice President Kamala Harris smiled and chatted from the dais before Biden's arrival.I respect the other side,"" McCarthy said earlier on Tuesday in a video. ""I can disagree on policy. But I want to make sure this country is stronger, economically sound, energy independent, secure and accountable.""Some House Republican lawmakers have questioned Biden's victory in the 2020 presidential race against Trump, vowing to investigate his Cabinet and family.Biden hailed the resilience and strength of the U.S. economy, with unemployment having dropped to a nearly 54-year low in January.He hammered corporations for profiteering from the pandemic and ran through a wish list of economic proposals, many of which are unlikely to be passed by Congress. They included a minimum tax for billionaires and a quadrupling of the tax on corporate stock buybacks.Biden was especially critical of oil companies' profits. ""I think it's outrageous,"" he said. He said the United States would need oil for at least another decade, drawing laughter from some in the chamber.(Reporting by Jeff Mason, Nandita Bose and Gram Slattery; Additional reporting by David Morgan, Andrea Shalal, Trevor Hunnicutt, Steve Holland, Costas Pitas and Dan Whitcomb; Editing by Heather Timmons and Howard Goller)",2023/2/8,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803775,Man City case could join list of soccer's biggest scandals,"LONDON (AP) — Manchester City is not the first high-profile soccer club to be caught up in a scandal.

            The Premier League has accused City of breaching a host of financial regulations, and the club could face a range of punishments including a fine or a deduction of points.

            As City mounts its defense, The Associated Press takes a look at scandals that hit have Europe’s leading leagues.











            FRANCE

            Marseille was the dominant club in France and a rising force in Europe under flamboyant club president Bernard Tapie.

            Marseille was playing Valenciennes in the league just six days before facing AC Milan in the European Cup final, and three Valenciennes were approached with bribes to throw the game. Tapie was convicted of rigging the match and later jailed.

            On May 20, 1993, defender Jacques Glassmann, forward Christophe Robert and winger Jorge Burruchaga were asked via middleman Jean-Jacques Eydelie — a former midfielder — to go easy.

            Robert, who went off early in the game, and Burruchaga, a World Cup winner with Argentina in 1986, accepted the money.

            Glassmann refused and then blew the whistle on the plot. He was awarded the 1995 FIFA Fair Play Award.

            Marseille beat Valenciennes and downed giant Milan 1-0 with a header from defender Basile Boli. Marseille remains the only French team to win the competition.

            Prosecutors charged Eydelie, who confessed to arranging the phone conversation between Marseille general manager Jean-Pierre Bernès and the three players.

            Robert’s wife, meanwhile, was charged with conspiracy after an envelope containing 250,000 francs (then about $43,000) was dug up from a back garden.

            Marseille kept its Champions League title but wasn't allowed to defend it. Marseille was stripped of its French league title, having won the previous four in a dominant era, and demoted to the second division.

            
                Tapie, who died in 2021, was ordered to stand down and in 1997 he started an eight-month prison term.

            Eydelie, Burruchaga, Robert were also sentenced to jail terms in a corruption scandal that sent shockwaves through French soccer. The club did not win the league again until 2010.

            UEFA

            European soccer's governing body has a hit-and-miss record punishing clubs suspected of cheating.

            Clubs alleged to have fixed games for betting scams in the Champions League qualifying rounds and the Europa League have been banned from UEFA competitions for up to 10 seasons.

            In higher-profile cases, Anderlecht and Manchester City won at the Court of Arbitration for Sport to overturn European bans of one and two seasons, respectively. City's case was regarding ""Financial Fair Play” rules.

            Anderlecht advanced to the 1984 UEFA Cup final by beating Nottingham Forest 3-0 after a two-goal loss in the first leg. In Brussels, a penalty awarded to Anderlecht and a disallowed stoppage-time goal for Forest raised suspicions.

            In 1997, Belgian media and legal cases revealed Anderlecht’s president admitted paying the Spanish referee — who had since died in a car crash — 13 years earlier.

            UEFA’s executive committee imposed a one-season ban from European competitions. Anderlecht won its appeal in 1998 when CAS ruled UEFA did not follow its proper judicial process.

            In 2020, Man City overturned a two-year ban imposed by a UEFA-appointed club finance panel. CAS judges decided the allegations of inflating sponsorship deals and breaching “Financial Fair Play” rules were not proven or the evidence was time-barred.

            UEFA has been on more solid ground in match-fixing cases. CAS upheld a 10-season ban for Skenderbeu from Albania, imposed in 2018, and an eight-season ban in 2009 for Pobeda of North Macedonia.

            ITALY

            Juventus again finds itself mired in scandal 17 years after one of the club’s darkest moments.

            The storied Italian club was hit last month with a 15-point penalty deduction for false accounting, while several of its former directors were handed bans from soccer activities. Former president Andrea Agnelli was banned for two years.

            Agnelli and the entire board of directors had resigned in November following an investigation by Turin prosecutors.

            At the start of the pandemic, Juventus said 23 players agreed to reduce their salary for four months to help the club through the crisis. But prosecutors claim the players gave up only one month’s salary.

            Juventus is appealing the Italian soccer federation’s decision, and a preliminary hearing for the investigation by Turin prosecutors is scheduled for March.

            The move comes 17 years after the “Calciopoli” refereeing scandal that saw Juventus, a record 36-time Italian champion, demoted to Serie B and stripped of two Serie A titles. There were also points penalties for other clubs, including AC Milan and Lazio.

            That shook Italian soccer but the Italy team restored some joy when it won the World Cup that year, just as it had done 24 year earlier following another scandal.

            Italy great Paolo Rossi was banned for two years for his involvement in the 1980 betting scandal known as “Totonero” while he was at Perugia.

            Rossi, who always professed his innocence, was bought by Juventus in 1981 and returned from his suspension at the end of the 1981-82 season — just in time for the World Cup.

            There he scored a hat trick against Brazil, two against Poland in the semifinal and the opening goal against West Germany to help Italy win the final.

            Rossi was named player of the tournament and he also went on to win the Ballon d’Or that year.

            SPAIN

            In 2019, more than 40 people were accused of fixing the Spanish league game between Levante and Zaragoza at the end of the 2010-11 season. Among those acquitted was former México coach Javier Aguirre, who now is with Mallorca. Two former Zaragoza officials were convicted of fraud and given a 15-month prison sentence.

            A year later, a former director of Spanish club Osasuna said the team made payments to fix Spanish league results. The payments were allegedly made to try to keep Osasuna in the first division both in 2012-13 and 2013-14.

            GERMANY

            A soccer scandal in the shadow of the Cold War shook up the Bundesliga in 1965 and led to one of the worst-ever seasons by any top-division team.

            West German club Hertha Berlin had a problem. Players didn’t want to sign for a club based in West Berlin, half of a divided city that was surrounded by communist-run East Germany. Hertha solved that problem with secret extra payments to players and was relegated as punishment — though allegations persist that other clubs had similar schemes that went unpunished.

            Political pressure for West Berlin to be represented in the Bundesliga led to woefully unprepared Tasmania Berlin being given a place just before the new season began. Tasmania scored just 15 goals all season, conceded 108 and held one game at the Olympiastadion with just 827 fans, meaning the huge arena was about 1% full.

            Germany's biggest scandal in the last decade came when Bayern Munich president Uli Hoeness was sentenced to prison for large-scale tax evasion in 2014. He was re-elected as Bayern president in 2016 following his release.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803797,Frank Vatrano's OT goal lifts Ducks over Blackhawks 3-2,"CHICAGO (AP) — Frank Vatrano scored 2:15 into overtime, and the Anaheim Ducks beat the Chicago Blackhawks 3-2 on Tuesday night in a matchup of two of the NHL's worst teams.

            Vatrano got his 12th goal when he beat Petr Mrazek from the left side of the net. Isac Lundestrom set up the game-winner with a cross-ice pass.

            “It was a great play by Lundy all around, to hold on to that puck and find a lane for me,"" Vatrano said.











            The Ducks improved to 4-0-1 in their last five games. It was Anaheim's first win against Chicago since Dec. 5, 2018, stopping an eight-game slide.

            “We've been going good as of late and before the (All-Star) break we were playing some good hockey,” Vatrano said. “We wanted to start after the break with some positivity.”

            Brett Leason and Jayson Megna each had a goal and an assist for Anaheim (17-29-6). John Klingberg had two assists, and Anthony Stolarz made 27 saves.

            “We just kept our heads down and kept swinging,” Anaheim coach Dallas Eakins said. “Lundstrom’s out there and he shows some patience. Franky Vatrano really woke up there in the third period and continued on to the overtime.”

            Chicago’s Jason Dickinson had a goal for the third straight game. Seth Jones also scored and Mrazek blocked 23 shots.

            With the game tied at 2, the Blackhawks controlled much of the action in the third period. But Stolarz stopped Dickinson’s point-blank shot with 7:40 left. Chicago defenseman Jake McCabe missed on a prime chance with just over six minutes remaining.

            “Yeah, that one hurts,” Dickinson said. “Feel like we should have won, but we let that one get away from us.”

            It was the first game for the Blackhawks since Hall of Fame forward Bobby Hull died last week at age 84. The organization paid tribute to Hull with a pregame moment of silence and a video of his career highlights.

            Troy Terry, Anaheim’s All-Star forward, was sidelined by an upper-body injury. He is day to day after he got hurt during a 3-2 shootout loss at Dallas on Monday.

            Blackhawks captain Jonathan Toews missed the game with a non-COVID-19 illness. 

            Dickinson opened the scoring at 1:36 of the second period. He beat Stolarz from the slot after Patrick Kane made a centering pass from the backboards.

            Leason tied it at 8:25, knocking in a rebound of his own shot with a one-handed swat.

            Jones put Chicago (15-29-5) back in front at 13:09. The All-Star defenseman jumped up to join a rush, took Dickinson’s cross-ice feed and connected from the slot. 

            Megna tied it at 2 at 15:42 with his first goal of the season and No. 11 for his career. He scored from the right circle after Jones lost the puck behind his own net.

            DEADLINE APPROACHING

            Kane said Monday that a few NHL teams had reached out to his agent, Pat Brisson, about a potential trade before the March 3 deadline. 

            Kane and Toews are in the final seasons of eight-year contracts with no-movement clauses. Both are represented by Brisson and would need to consent to a deal that might bring rebuilding Chicago draft picks or prospects.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803798,"Jokic posts triple-double by halftime, Nuggets rout Wolves","DENVER (AP) — Nikola Jokic may not always dazzle with his athleticism. He sure does with his numbers.Jokic posted his 19th triple-double of the season by halftime and the Denver Nuggets rode a 49-point first quarter to a 146-112 rout of the Minnesota Timberwolves on Tuesday night.Jokic finished with 20 points, 16 assists and 12 rebounds. It was the second time in his career the big man has notched a triple-double by halftime. Jokic took a seat late in the third quarter with the Western Conference leaders ahead by a large margin.“It’s incredible he had a triple-double in the first half,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. “LeBron (James) did it with just so much athleticism and Nikola does it with much un-athleticism — but equally as effective.""Denver led 49-19 after the first quarter — including a 32-2 run — as the Nuggets shot 79.2% from the floor. The 49 points tied for the second-most in a quarter in the franchise's NBA history. Michael Porter Jr. led the way by scoring 19 of his 30 points in the opening period.Aaron Gordon added 24 for the Nuggets, who set season highs in points and assists (44).“Everybody who was in today's game was kind of doing the simple things,” Jokic explained. ""We didn’t do anything complicated. So we didn’t turn the ball over, and we were just playing the right way.”Anthony Edwards and Luka Garza both had 19 points for Minnesota. D’Angelo Russell was ejected after picking up two technical fouls in the third quarter. He finished with 10 points.“We didn’t play with a lot of physicality. It wasn’t there early,” Timberwolves coach Chris Finch said. “Bunch of bad turnovers to start the game, then transition was a disaster. Their shot-making, they got hot and it was over. They kicked our butt in every way you can.”It was much different than Sunday in Minnesota, where the Timberwolves cruised past Denver 128-98. But in that game, the Nuggets were without four starters: Jokic, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Jamal Murray and Gordon.Murray also missed Tuesday's game due to inflammation in his right knee. He was sidelined all last season as he recovered from a torn ACL in his left knee.The Nuggets had 12 players who scored at least five points and the team finished at 62.4% shooting from the field.“We had a night where we were firing on all cylinders,” Malone said. “When we play like that, it’s a lot of fun to watch.”TIP-INSTimberwolves: F Kyle Anderson was sidelined with back spasms. ... G Austin Rivers served the second of his three-game suspension for his part in last Friday’s fight between Minnesota and the Orlando Magic.Nuggets: F Zeke Nnaji was out with a sprained right shoulder. ... G Bruce Brown appeared to turn his ankle early in the game, but returned and finished with nine points. ... It was Jokic's 95th career triple-double. ... Porter was plus-43 for the game. “When I told him plus-43, his smile was ear to ear,” Malone recounted.TRADE TALKNuggets guard Bones Hyland didn't play as his name surfaces in trade speculation. The trade deadline is Thursday.“Bones is one of my favorite players,” Porter told the media contingent during the morning shootaround. “I wish he would stay here. I wish it could be figured out.""KAT APPEARANCETimberwolves center Karl-Anthony Towns joined the team on the trip, but there’s no timetable for his return from a strained right calf.“It’s good for him to get back in the mindset of being around the team, start to fall into the rhythm of what that is,” Finch said. “Just having him around has been great.”UP NEXTTimberwolves: At Utah on Wednesday night.Nuggets: Start a three-game trip Thursday at Orlando.___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/2/9,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803799,"Nowell, No. 12 Kansas State finish fast, top No. 17 TCU","MANHATTAN, Kan. (AP) — Markquis Nowell scored 18 points and No. 12 Kansas State finished strong, snapping a two-game skid by beating No. 17 TCU 82-61 on Tuesday night.

            The Wildcats outscored TCU 17-2 to end the game.

            “Coach got on our butts,” Nowell said about the sudden surge. “We just locked in a little bit more. We knew how important this game was. To get this win was big and it gives us momentum.











            “You can't give life to TCU because they're a second-half team. They can make a run at any given time. We just knew to stay focused,” he said.

            Kansas State (19-5, 7-4 Big 12), which lost to TCU earlier this season, moved within a game of first-place Texas in a crowded conference race. The Wildcats are tied with Kansas, a half-game behind Iowa State.

            Keyontae Johnson and Desi Sills each had 14 points for Kansas State, Tykei Greene added 13 and David N'Guessan had 10.

            TCU (17-7, 6-5) was led by Damion Baugh with 14 points. Micah Peavy and Jakobe Coles each had 11 and Emanuel Miller had 10.

            ""Obviously they played well and we didn't,"" TCU coach Jamie Dixon said. “You can't make it any more simple than that. Being outrebounded by 12 and 19 turnovers, that doesn't give you much of a chance.”

            TCU played without preseason Big 12 Player of the Year Mike Miles Jr., who missed his third straight game after hyper-extending his knee Jan. 28 against Mississippi.

            Nowell, who spent his first three seasons at Arkansas-Little Rock, hit a short jumper in the first half to record his 1,700th career point. He also passed Steve Henson's school record with his 187th assist of the season late in the game.

            “Any time you set an all-time record, that's a really big deal,” K-State coach Jerome Tang said. “Steve Henson is a really big deal. The guys Steve Henson played with were really good players. It says two things; Quis is blessed with vision, and there are really good players around him because they're putting it in the hole.”

            Johnson again struggled with foul trouble. He picked up two offensive fouls in the first 10 minutes, after collecting two in the first minute-plus Saturday against Texas. He finished the half with five points, but was limited to 10 minutes of action.

            Holding a two-point lead, Kansas State went on a 13-2 run early in the second half to open up a comfortable lead. TCU closed to 65-59 with 4:49 left, but an alley-oop slam by Greene punctuated an 11-0 run that iced the game.

            Kansas State blew a halftime lead in its last game, a loss against Texas last Saturday. Tang was tough on his players in the days between the two games, and he's glad his message was received.

            “I really felt like they needed that from me,” he said. “Everybody was on egg shells (the past two days) on purpose because there needed to be a sense of urgency.”

            “I'm really glad they got the point. I don't mind being the bad guy, but it wouldn't be very fun for (the players) and my staff wouldn't like me very much. So you hope you have guys who understand so the drive comes from within the locker room, rather than the coaching staff.

            The Wildcats led 36-30 at halftime. They had six turnovers before the break after having 20 in the first game against the Horned Frogs.

            THE TAKEAWAY

            TCU: The Horned Frogs really need to get healthy. Playing without Miles, they've lost two in a row. They miss his scoring (18.1 points per game). But they miss his leadership even more. There is no timetable for his return, but he is expected back sometime before the end of the season.

            Kansas State: The Wildcats have a home-court advantage at Bramlage Coliseum. They improved to 13-1 at home this season, and they use the enthusiasm of the crowd to gain momentum.

            UP NEXT

            TCU: The Horned Frogs will host Baylor on Saturday. They defeated the Bears 88-87 Jan. 4 in Waco.

            Kansas State: The Wildcats travel to Texas Tech Saturday. They defeated the Red Raiders 66-58 in Manhattan back on Jan. 21.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803800,United Airlines flight turns around after fire in cabin,"SAN DIEGO (AP) — A fire on board a New Jersey-bound United Airlines plane prompted it to return to San Diego International Airport and four people were taken to a hospital for treatment for smoke inhalation, authorities said.

            Flight 2664 was heading to Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey when a passenger's external battery pack caught fire shortly after takeoff Tuesday morning, authorities said.

            Passenger Caroline Lipinski told KFMB-TV that a few minutes after takeoff, a bag belonging to a first-class passenger began smoking.











            “He threw something on the ground and it was a battery charger pack or something from his laptop, it burst into fire,” she said.

            “There was smoke in the cabin, I was terrified,"" she said.

            Passenger Stephan Jones said some passengers “were gasping, screaming” while flight attendants grabbed fire extinguishers and ran to the front of the plane.

            The crew placed the battery in a special fire bag, which prevented it from spreading, and the Boeing 737 returned safely to the airport at around 7:30 a.m., authorities said. 

            Four passengers were treated for smoke inhalation at a hospital, UC San Diego Health said in a statement.

            Several flight attendants were taken to the hospital as a precaution, United Airlines said in a statement that thanked crew members “for their quick actions in prioritizing the safety of everyone on board.” 

            Two other people declined to be taken to the hospital, the San Diego Fire-Rescue Department said.

            The remaining passengers departed for New Jersey aboard a second plane at about 11:45 a.m., KSWB-TV reported.

            The Federal Aviation Administration will investigate the incident. 

            Lithium-ion batteries are widely used in electronic devices but also have been known to overheat and cause fires. Airlines permit them on carry-on luggage but not in checked bags.

            In December, a Lufthansa flight from Los Angeles to Germany was diverted to Chicago after a laptop caught fire on board.

            Also in December, A JetBlue plane from Barbados to New York was evacuated in New York after a fire that may have started with a battery, authorities said. More than 160 passengers were evacuated using emergency slides. Five received minor injuries.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803801,Australian prosecutor alleges principal molested 3 sisters,"CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — A former principal of a ultra-Orthodox Jewish girls school in the Australian city of Melbourne molested three sisters, a prosecutor said Wednesday. 

            Malka Leifer, 56, has pleaded not guilty in the Victoria state County Court to 29 sexual offenses that were allegedly committed at the Adass Israel School and at her Melbourne home as well as at school camps at the Victorian rural towns of Blampied and Rawson between 2003 and 2007.

            The school was excited by Tel Aviv-born Leifer’s arrival from Israel in 2001, when the sisters were aged around 12, 14 and 16, prosecutor Justin Lewis told the jury in his opening address.











            “The complainants were aware that the accused had been brought over to Australia from Israel to teach by the school because of her good reputation,” Lewis said.

            Leifer was married with eight children, two of them born in 2004 and 2005 while she was at the school, Lewis said. 

            She began as head of religious studies at the school and in 2003 became the principal. She decided to give the sisters teaching positions after they finished their final year of high school.

            Leifer had a tendency to “take advantage of their vulnerability, ignorance in sexual matters and her position of authority,” Lewis said.

            The girls came from a sheltered environment within Melbourne’s ultra-Orthodox Hasidic community. The family did not have a television, newspapers, magazines or access to the internet at home, Lewis said.

            “It was not acceptable within the community to say anything against a person of high standing in the community, especially as a child,” Lewis said. “As a result of being raised in an ultra-Orthodox community, the three complainants did not have any knowledge or understanding of sex throughout the period of the alleged offending.”

            “As part of their religious and cultural practices, the complainants were not taught anything about sex until they were engaged to be married,” he added. 

            Leifer sat in a dock at the back of the court room wearing a long black skirt, a black and gold sweater and a black wrap over her hair, holding a small black book in her hands.

            The eldest sister was a student and then a teacher at the school when she was allegedly molested by Leifer.

            The sister “did not know about sex and didn’t know that people touched each other. She was confused,” Lewis said.

            “She felt too scared to move and scared of what the consequences would be if she told the accused to stop, especially because of the high esteem in which the accused was held within the school,” Lewis added.

            Leifer left the school in March 2008. The sisters reported the abuse allegations to social worker Chana Rabinowitz, psychiatrist Lorraine Dennerstein and psychologist Vicki Gordon between 2008 and 2014, Lewis said.

            Defense lawyer Ian Hill told the jury that one of the sisters had told Gordon “she believed she had lost her virginity” to a man while in high school. A former husband of another sister would testify that he had overheard his wife say that Rabinowitz “made a big deal” about her relationship with Leifer and was “taking it out of all proportion,” Hill said.

            That was around the time in 2008 that Rabinowitz raised the allegations against Leifer with authorities.

            Hill said that one of the sisters gave an account to psychiatrist Natalie Krapivensky that contradicts some of the allegations on trial.

            The three sisters had an ""exceptionally difficult home life” because their mother was “physically, verbally and emotionally abusive to each of them in unimaginable and sadistic ways,” Hill said.

            “There will be other evidence about the positive, glowing, appropriate relationship between the three sisters and Mrs. Leifer,” Hill said. “An issue will become as to whether, in fact, they took on Mrs. Leifer, in effect, as a substitute parent in view of what was happening at home.”

            Leifer denies that any sexual activity took place. But Hill noted that the sisters were old enough to legally consent to the sexual acts alleged in 21 of the 29 charges.

            The sisters are expected to begin testifying when the trial resumes on Thursday. Media are not allowed to report the testimonies of alleged victims of sexual assault in Victoria.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803804,"In Spain, storks' trash diet driven by climate change","COLMENAR VIEJO, Spain (AP) — The storks float and swoop in formation, circling over a landfill in the foothills of the Sierra de Guadarrama mountains north of Madrid. Then a garbage truck pulls up and disgorges its contents. One by one, they dive to the ground: breakfast is here.

            Europe’s storks used to fly south to Africa’s Sahel region to spend the winter, stopping off in Spain along the way. But with higher temperatures driven by human-caused climate change and abundant food available at open-air waste disposal sites, most adult storks no longer make the long and exhausting journey.

            At Madrid’s Colmenar Viejo landfill, around 100 trucks a day dump household waste into a crater that is then covered with sand by diggers. Hundreds of white storks have built nests up to six feet long on roofs and in the bell tower of the nearby church. There are even nests on streetlights. 











            “This is a stork paradise because they have grass, pastures and then the landfill, so they have it all here,” said Alejandro López García, who is studying Madrid’s stork population for his PhD at Madrid’s Complutense University.

            Researchers found 36,217 of Europe’s approximately 450,000 white storks in Spain in fall 2020, accordingto a census. That makes it the most popular host country for this breed on the continent, along with Poland. In the Madrid area alone, López García said, his working group recently counted 2,300 breeding pairs of birds, compared with just 200 registered in 1984. 

            The higher temperatures are likely to keep rising, meaning more and more birds will be drawn to Madrid in winter. Other species like swallows are also no longer migrating further south into Africa. Researchers at Zurich Technical University have predicted that the average temperature in the Spanish capital's coldest month will increase by 3.1 Celsius (37.5 F) by 2050.

            The storks feed on insects, rodents and worms they pull from rubbish, supplementing their diet. But for this traditional symbol of good luck and fertility, danger lurks among the mounting piles of trash.

            “With better weather and higher temperatures, insects and worms are more freely available for the storks to eat,” said Blas Molina, an ornithologist working with Spanish bird charity SEO/Birdlife. “But every year chicks and adults die because they ingest plastics or rubber that they think are worms,” Molina added. “In many cases, their legs get tangled in plastic cords cutting off their blood supply, and they die from that eventually.”

            The negative effects of the storks' garbage diet also reach human populations. Storks from across Europe will still make a short hop southwards during the winter, but if they are feeding at trash sites then potentially toxic chemicals can be transferred to reservoirs and drinking water sources they stop at along the way. “All the pollutants that you have here, or potentially toxic compounds, end up in those waters,” López García explained.

            There is also a clear trend for storks to build nests away from traditional wetlands to urban-adjacent areas, López García said. These large birds are fiercely loyal to their nesting sites and will return to them year after year, concentrating their populations around landfills across Spain.

            Increasingly, humans and storks are living alongside each other, in a sometimes awkward compromise. White storks can boast a wingspan of up to 7 feet, and can weigh up to 10 pounds, so require ample space to nest. In Rivas-Vaciamadrid, a commuter town to the southeast of Madrid, the birds have settled in the metro station and local church. 

            Councilwoman Carmen Rebollo called the storks “our neighbors,” and said the birds were generally well liked. However, managing their living space was a challenge. “The only difficulty that we can have with them is that at a certain moment they make excessively heavy nests or they can damage a roof, but at that moment we try to reduce, adapt or move the nests,"" she said. 

            López García admitted that the rapid spread of storks in the last few decades around Madrid had caused tensions. “Areas with two nests in the village church, in the municipality or in the town hall is fine, but if the concentration is 30 nests, well then that can start to bother people,” he said.

            Now that the storks have altered their migration and breeding patterns to adapt to the plentiful garbage piles on offer, a new threat looms. In 2020, Spain adopted into national law a European Union directive that aims to stop all organic waste ending up in landfills. This is precisely the waste that fills with mice, insects and worms that the storks flock to eat.

            “This means that the food they are eating right now would cease to exist,” López García said, suggesting that an area for storks to feed to be maintained at the garbage dumps. “What we’re proposing is that there’s a smooth transition that doesn’t happen overnight or a closure of landfills.”

            However, the ultimate benefit of reducing planet-warming methane by cutting organic material in dump sites outweighs the benefit of the food source that the storks can find here, according to López García. “In the medium-to-long term, the feeding from landfills is negative for them,” he said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803805,"Gardner, Beekman lift No. 8 Virginia past No. 22 N.C. State","CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) — Virginia coach Tony Bennett had a simple message for his team after a poor defensive performance in a loss at Virginia Tech. 

            “Talk is cheap. Do it. Show us, to our players, to us as a staff, show up, work in practice, step to between the lines and don’t lose yourself in anything but what your job is,” Bennett said he told his players and assistants in the two days of practice since the 74-68 loss.

            The team clearly got the message. 











            Jayden Gardner scored 18 points, Reece Beekman added 15 and No. 8 Virginia cooled off red-hot No. 22 North Carolina State 63-50 on Tuesday night.

            “We had a great two days before State, you know, preparation and just diving in,” Gardner said. “It’s just this is the time of the season we need to lock in and you know, we’re playing for something. ... We're trying to win a championship.”

            The Cavaliers (18-4, 10-3 Atlantic Coast Conference) handed the Wolfpack (19-6, 9-5) their second loss in 10 games and moved into a share of first place in the conference with Clemson and Pittsburgh.

            The Wolfpack arrived leading the ACC with an average of 79.6 points and were 19-2 when scoring at least 70, but became the 38th consecutive league opponent held below 70 points at John Paul Jones Arena.

            “Obviously, as I watched the Virginia Tech game and knew that those guys dropped the game and, you know, any time you’re going to play a very good defensive team on their home floor, you know you’re going to get that energy,” North Carolina State coach Kevin Keatts said.

            Terquavion Smith led N.C. State with 19 points and Casey Morsell, who spent his first two seasons at Virginia and was jeered nearly every time he touched the ball in his first game back, had 18 points before fouling out in the final minute.

            Jarkel Joiner, the Wolfpack's No. 2 scorer at 16.2 points per game, missed 12 of his 14 shots and scored five points. D.J. Burns Jr. (eight points) was the only other Wolfpack player to score.

            Reserve forward Kadin Shedrick, who did not play in Virginia's loss at Virginia Tech on Saturday, had 10 points and six rebounds for the Cavaliers.

            Virginia scored the first six points of the second half to open its largest lead at 40-20, but the Wolfpack began whittling away, fueled by a 12-6 burst in which Smith and Morsell each hit a pair of 3-pointers.

            “In the past, we’ve been able to control the tempo and to get those guys to play a little bit faster and even turn them over,” said Keatts, whose team had won three of the last four meetings. “But we couldn’t.”

            N.C. State twice closed within nine points but got no closer. Morsell's 3 made it 55-46 with 3:46 to play, but Beekman made a free throw and then took a no-look pass from Kihei Clark for an easy backdoor layup.

            Virginia closed the first half on an 8-2 run to lead 34-20 at the break. The Wolfpack missed 10 straight shots before Burns scored just before the half.

            BIG PICTURE

            N.C. State: The Wolfpack got scoring from just three players — Smith with nine points, Morsell with seven and Burns with four — in the opening half. They shot 25.8% with Smith going 4 for 13 and Joiner 0 for 6. ... Burns picked up his third personal foul less than a minute into the second half after getting the ball stolen by Beekman. He stayed in the game and drew his fourth foul on a drive by Clark with 16:03 left.

            Virginia: Beekman started the game ranking first in the ACC in assist/turnover ratio (3.0) and third in assists (5.1). He had four assists and one turnover. Clark started first in assists (6.0) and second in assist/turnover ratio (2.8). He had six assists and three turnovers.

However, many Hong Kong workers experienced disruptions to their retirement planning due to COVID-19. Now, with society gradually moving towards a post-pandemic world, AIA Hong Kong has announced the results of its ""14th Desired Retirement Tracker"" (the survey), which analysed Hong Kong workers' changing attitudes towards retirement preparations amidst the resumption of normal activities and revealed their views according to the four primary aspects of retirement.        The ""14th AIA Desired Retirement Tracker"" reveals the attitudes of working people in Hong Kong towards retirement in the post-pandemic ""new normal"" and offers suggestions on aspects including retirement savings, medical protection, physical and mental wellbeing, and retirement investment.                  Pictured is Ms. Elaine Lau, Chief Corporate Solutions Officer of AIA Hong Kong and Macau.     Key findings were as follows:   Retirement savings        Forty-seven percent of respondents have increased their personal savings over the past three years (i.e., during the COVID-19 pandemic). Of these, 41% have achieved extra savings of more than HK$40,000.           Seventy-three percent of respondents said they will increase their entertainment spending as their social lives return to normal. Well over half (58%) plan to use their savings for so-called “revenge” travel, while 46% plan to travel in the next three to six months with an estimated budget of HK$22,918 (median).    Medical protection        Among respondents who have been infected with COVID-19, 80% agree life is fragile and that they should enhance their medical protection. However, only 17% have purchased additional medical insurance since having the virus.           Among all respondents, 22% do not have any medical insurance and 13% have group medical insurance only, meaning 35% may lack medical protection after retirement.    Physical and mental wellbeing        Fifty-eight percent of respondents prefer a hybrid working mode and hope to work from home an average of 2.8 days per week. However, 76% think that work-from-home arrangements cause the boundary between work and personal life to blur.    Retirement investment        Seventy-eight percent of respondents would like to have sustainable investment elements in their retirement investment portfolios, while 80% admit that they do not know how to choose ESG MPF products.         Detailed survey results       Retirement savings: affected by revenge consumption and travel   The survey revealed that nearly half of respondents (47%) have increased their personal savings over the past three years due to reduced travel or shopping. Of these, around 40% have achieved extra savings of over HK$40,000. Also, after three years of pandemic restrictions, people are ready to increase their spending on entertainment and travel: 73% of respondents will spend more on entertainment as social life returns to normal; 58% plan to travel; and nearly half (46%) plan to travel in the next three to six months, with an estimated budget of HK$22,918 (median) to include flight tickets, accommodations, shopping, etc.   Medical protection: people agree on its importance but fail to act   The survey also explored views on medical protection among respondents who have been infected with COVID-19. Eighty percent said ""life is fragile and [I] should enhance [my] medical protection"", yet only 17% have purchased additional medical insurance since they had the virus, demonstrating that only a small portion of people have taken action to acquire additional medical protection. Respondents gave three main reasons as to why they have not purchased additional medical insurance: 42% said they plan to use only public medical services in the future, 38% have insufficient funds, and 19% think the protection provided by their employer's group medical insurance is adequate.   Among all respondents, more than one fifth (22%) do not own any individual medical insurance and 13% have group medical insurance only, which means 35% of respondents may lack medical protection after retirement. As medical expenditures increase with age, their retirement savings may be insufficient for their actual needs.   Physical and mental wellbeing: work-life imbalance affects health    As society returns to normalcy, some businesses have gone back to office working arrangements. However, the survey revealed that nearly 60% of respondents (58%) prefer a hybrid working mode (i.e., one that gives employees the flexibility to work from office or home) and hope to work from home an average of 2.8 days per week.   However, there were underlying concerns. Seventy-six percent of respondents agree that work-from-home arrangements cause the boundary between work and personal life to blur, 70% think they result in longer working hours, and 64% think they will reduce social lives and hence contribute to a stronger sense of solitude.   Retirement investment: interested in ESG investment, but hindered by limited knowledge   The pandemic has taught the lesson that individuals, society and the environment are interdependent. The survey found that 78% of respondents would like to incorporate sustainable investment elements into their retirement investment portfolios. However, respondents also have limited knowledge of ESG investments1: 80% admit that they do not know how to choose ESG MPF products, and 60% think ESG investments are limited to environmental protection or carbon reduction.       Suggestions         Ms. Elaine Lau, Chief Corporate Solutions Officer of AIA Hong Kong and Macau, remarked, ""We are pleased to see the community return to a more normal way of life. But while it is understandable that people are looking forward to increasing their spending on travel and social activities in a post-pandemic world, it is still crucial to strike a balance between spending, saving and building healthy financial habits. In addition, it is not advisable to rely solely on group medical insurance for medical protection. To build stronger health cover, working people should start simple. For example, they could make MPF Tax Deductible Voluntary Contributions and purchase a Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme based on their own needs to establish a more adequate retirement and medical safety net while also enjoying tax deductions.""   Ms. Lau added, ""The survey found that working people have become more aware of their physical and mental wellbeing and are more determined to pursue a healthy lifestyle than before. AIA strives to go beyond traditional employee benefits by bringing together group insurance and workforce wellness, providing employee benefits solutions that cover physical, mental, social and financial wellbeing and help the public live 'Healthier, Longer, Better Lives'. As for ESG, promoting the sustainable and healthier development of society has always been one of our corporate strategic priorities. As interest in ESG-related MPF funds rises among our members, we will continue to offer educational tools through a variety of channels to enhance their knowledge of ESG and related funds.""       Detailed suggestions for Hong Kong workers      Retirement savings                        Strive for balance between spending and saving                 While people's desire to spend more on travel and social activities in a post-pandemic environment is understandable, it is recommended that they still aim to strike a balance between spending and saving and to build a habit of making regular savings.                         Saving for retirement is a long-term discipline. With the snowball effect of compound interest2, every dollar saved may yield higher returns over time. When preparing a retirement plan, one should cultivate a savings habit, practise prudent financial management, and consider increasing savings and investment amounts whenever possible, making good use of qualifying deferred annuity products and MPF Tax Deductible Voluntary Contributions (TVC) to reduce retirement reserve shortfalls while enjoying tax deductions.                 Medical protection     Get medical protection as soon as possible              Employees:                The pandemic has underscored the importance of having medical protection. Employees should not neglect the need for individual medical insurance even if they are covered by their employer's group plan. In addition, group medical insurance will become invalid after retirement or departure from a company. Medical insurance premiums tend to be more expensive after retirement, and medical insurance options and cover are more limited due to increased health conditions. Without adequate individual medical insurance, employees may find themselves facing a medical protection shortfall – or find that they have no protection at all.                           Employees are advised to arrange for medical protection as early as possible. They may want to consider purchasing medical insurance during their employment, for example through a Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme (VHIS) or portable employee voluntary medical protection plans. Under such options, protection will continue even after departure from a company or retirement. Moreover, a VHIS offers guaranteed renewal up to 100 years of age, greatly increasing the duration of one's medical protection.            Employers:                Employers should regularly evaluate whether their group medical insurance plans are able to meet the varying needs of their employees. Some group insurance providers offer packages and tailor-made solutions to fit different business budgets. These solutions also offer protection for group medical, life, critical illness, personal accident, dental and business travel to provide comprehensive protection for employees.                 Physical and mental wellbeing     Establish a healthy lifestyle   Employees:                Embrace a healthy lifestyle by getting regular medical check-ups, exercising and adhering to a healthy diet. Joining a programme such as ""AIA Vitality"" is a positive step towards living 'Healthier, Longer, Better Lives'.                           Build a sense of personal fulfilment by actively engaging in the community, developing a positive self-image and living a meaningful life.                           Stay positive by understanding and managing mental health and seeking help when in need.            Employers:                Build an inclusive working environment and support network to enhance employees' sense of belonging and self-worth.                           Choose providers that offer comprehensive employee benefits solutions to help employees stay healthy.                 Retirement investment    Increase knowledge of ESG investing concepts                 Before making ESG-related investment decisions, MPF members should understand clearly the details and risks of the funds. When comparing different funds, they should be cautious and not just follow the crowd. They should also regularly review their investment to ensure it continues to match their investment objectives.                         ESG concepts can be incorporated through MPF management. Examples include investing in MPF funds with ESG concepts, and managing MPF via e-channels to minimise the environmental impact of paper consumption.                         MPF members may want to consider providers that have extensive experience with ESG-related MPF funds and products.                    The ""14th AIA Desired Retirement Tracker"" was conducted between 31 October and 11 November 2022 through online questionnaires and face-to-face interviews. A total of 1,023 working people in Hong Kong aged 18-65 and with at least one MPF account were interviewed regarding their goals, views on their desired retirement life and the possibility of achieving it. Survey data was weighted according to the distribution of Hong Kong's working population (including factors such as age, gender and monthly personal income) to ensure that the sample fully reflected the characteristics of Hong Kong's working population. The survey was conducted by Cimigo, an independent market research and consultancy agency.        1 ESG investments incorporate environmental, social and governance elements into the investment decision-making process.          2 Reference:      MPFA    Hashtag: #AIA

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803808,Fiery mud volcano erupts in southern Taiwan,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A temple in Wandan Township in Pingtung County was the scene of an incredible sight as flames and mud spewed from four fumaroles.The eruption occurred in the early hours of Feb. 8 with mud flying as high as two meters, and flames doubling this height both in front and on the right side of the Huangyuan Temple, according to a Liberty Times report.Flames caused damage to nearby power cables, and Taipower rushed to the scene to cut electricity and prevent further damage to the power grid. The Wandan Fire Department also arrived on the scene, though they did not attempt to put out the flames.Wandan Township Wannei Village Chief Chen Yu-yi (陳玉意) said he had just gone to bed when he heard the news of the eruption just after midnight. After arriving at the scene, he found one of the three fumaroles in front of the temple was ignited, and shortly thereafter, fire spread to all three fumaroles.Chen said an excavator would be dispatched to the scene to deal with the freshly spewed mud which had begun to form a deep pool around the temple. Wandan’s mud volcano seems to erupt on a semi-annual basis, which attracts tourists to the site, with the last eruption occurring on Oct. 26.For farmers in the area, the mud volcano is mostly a nuisance as it damages nearby fields. Adjacent rice fields had just recently been planted. The previous eruption in October spilled over onto pumpkin fields which could not survive the hot mud and clogged irrigation.Located at the junction of Wandan Township and Xinyuan Township in Pingtung, the Wandan Mud Volcano is fueled by abundant underground natural gas. It is one of a half dozen such mud volcanoes in Taiwan, while around 1,100 have been identified on or near land, the majority of which appear with no flames.",2023/2/8,3413,Environment

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803838,Nevada lithium mine wins ruling; green energy fights rage on,"RENO, Nev. (AP) — A U.S. judge has ordered the government to revisit part of its environmental review of a lithium mine planned in Nevada, but denied opponents’ efforts to block it in a ruling the developer says clears the way for construction at the nation's largest known deposit of the rare metal widely used in rechargeable batteries.

            The ruling marks a significant victory for Canada-based Lithium Americas Corp. at its subsidiary’s project near Nevada's border with Oregon, and a setback — at least for now — for conservationists, tribes and a Nevada rancher who have all been fighting it for two years. The opponents said they are considering an appeal based in part on growing questions raised about the reach of an 150-year-old mining law.

            It’s the latest development in a series of high-stakes legal battles that pit environmentalists and others against so-called “green energy” projects President Joe Biden’s administration is pushing to help speed the nation’s transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy. 











            The White House says the mine on the Nevada-Oregon line is critical to ramped up efforts to producing raw materials for electric vehicle batteries.

            Critics argue digging for lithium poses the same ecological threats as mining for any other mineral or metal in the biggest gold-mining state in the U.S. They say efforts to downplay potential environmental and cultural impacts amount to “greenwashing,”

            “We need truly just and sustainable solutions for the climate crisis, and not be digging ourselves deeper into the biodiversity crisis,” said Greta Anderson, deputy director of the Western Watersheds Project, one of the plaintiffs considering an appeal.

            U.S. District Judge Miranda Du in Reno concluded late Monday that the opponents had failed to prove the project the U.S. Bureau of Land Management approved in January 2021 would harm wildlife habitat, degrade groundwater or pollute the air. 

            She also denied — for the third time — relief sought by Native American tribes who argued it could destroy a nearby sacred site where their ancestors were massacred in 1865.

            In her 49-page ruling, Du emphasized deference to a federal agency's approval of such projects. But she also acknowledged the complexity of laws regulating energy exploration under a recent U.S. appellate court ruling she adopted that could pose new challenges for those staking claims under the Mining Law of 1872.

            “While this case encapsulates the tensions among competing interests and policy goals, this order does not somehow pick a winner based on policy considerations,"" Du warned in the introduction of her verdict.

            Other projects that face legal challenges in U.S. court in Nevada include a proposed lithium mine where a desert wildflower has been declared endangered, and a proposed geothermal power plant on federal land near habitat for an endangered toad.

            Last week, General Motors Co. announced it had conditionally agreed to invest $650 million in Lithium Americas in a deal that will give GM exclusive access to the first phase of the Thacker Pass mine 200 miles (321 kilometers) northeast of Reno. The equity investment is contingent on the project clearing the final environmental and legal challenges it faces in federal court.

            “The favorable ruling leaves in place the final regulatory approval needed in moving Thacker Pass into construction,” Jonathan Evans, Lithium Americas’ president and CEO, said in a statement Tuesday. The company expects production to begin in the second half of 2026.

            Du handed a partial victory to environmentalists in agreeing that the Bureau of Land Management had failed to determine whether the company had valid mining rights on 1,300 acres (526 hectares) adjacent to the mine site where Lithium Nevada intends to bury waste rock.

            But she denied the opponents’ request to vacate the agency’s approval of the overall project’s Record of Decision, which would have prohibited any construction from beginning until a new record of decision was issued.

            Environmentalists clung to the lone part of her decision favorable to them. That part incorporates a recent ruling by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in a fight over the Mining Law of 1872 in a case in Arizona that could prove more onerous to mining companies that want to dispose of their waste on neighboring federal lands.

            
                The San Francisco-based appellate court upheld an Arizona ruling that the Forest Service lacked authority to approve Rosemont Copper’s plans to dispose of waste rock on land adjacent to the mine it wanted to dig on a national forest southeast of Tucson. The service and the Bureau of Land Management long have interpreted the mining law to convey the same mineral rights to such lands.

            The Spartans (15-9, 7-6 Big Ten) used an 8-0 run in which Walker made a layup and 3-pointer wrapped around a 3 from Jaden Akins for a 52-48 lead with 7:44 remaining and Michigan State led for the remainder.

            The Terrapins erupted for a 12-0 run in less than three minutes in the second half turning a 38-26 deficit into a 38-all tie. Young and Hart posted back-to-back three-point plays, and Hart’s 3-pointer with 13:01 knotted it at 38. Prior to that 3, Hart was 3-for-last-27 shooting from beyond the arc. Maryland finished shooting 3 of 22 from distance.

            Michigan State started the game with a 15-0 run and led 31-22 at halftime. Coming off an 81-46 win over Maryland (16-8, 7-6 Big Ten) on Saturday, the Terrapins have yet to win back-to-back contests in almost three years.

            The Terrapins host Penn State on Saturday. Michigan State travels to play Ohio State on Sunday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803842,LeBron James makes NBA history on a star-filled night in LA,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Bronny James stepped over to his dad's locker and played the phone video he had taken of Tuesday night's biggest moment. The NBA's new scoring king tipped his head back in a rich, full-throated laugh when the audio revealed Bronny had anticipated that the historic basket would come on a fadeaway jumper.

            “That's tough, that's tough,” LeBron James said. “That's funny.”

            For James, the greatest cost of nearly two decades in the NBA is the family time he misses. When he reached arguably the greatest individual basketball milestone of all by passing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's career scoring record, James' mother, wife and three children all witnessed the coronation.











            They were right at courtside in a building packed with stars and roaring fans who rose in waves of anticipation every time he touched the ball.

            James has been thriving under formidable pressure his entire adult life, and this was nothing the King couldn't handle — although the man who says he almost never cries had tears in his eyes after he made history with that nimble step-back shot in the third quarter.

            “I had a moment when it happened, and I embraced that moment,” James said afterward. “Seeing my family and friends, the people that’s been around me since I started this journey to the NBA, definitely very emotional right there. Just a kid from a small town in Ohio. I had a moment there, but I don’t think it’s really hit me, what just transpired.”

            When James surpassed Abdul-Jabbar’s record 38,387 points, a crowd that had roared for his every basket went the craziest of all.

            “A lot of people wanted me to go to the skyhook to break the record, or one of the signature dunks,” James said with a grin. “But the fadeaway is a signature play as well.”

            The Los Angeles crowd screamed and stomped with every point while James steadily surged toward the mark held since April 1984 by Abdul-Jabbar, who watched the game from a baseline seat near the Los Angeles bench.

            With four championship rings and nearly every other honor available to a basketball player, the 38-year-old James closed in on this next moment in history with the confidence of a player who has been even better than anyone could have expected two decades ago when the kid from Akron, Ohio, reached the NBA.

            “The expectations were all the way out to Pluto, and he went ahead and created his own galaxy,” Lakers coach Darvin Ham said before his team's 133-130 loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder.

            The crowd was in its seats far earlier than normal in Los Angeles, and James got numerous ovations before the Lakers and Thunder got rolling. Lakers fans turned out in droves for the chance to see a once-in-a-generation achievement, with tickets going for thousands on the secondary market.

            The moment was irresistible to fans like Aaron Sanchez, one of the hundreds of jersey-clad Lakers faithful patiently taking turns posing in front of the statue of Abdul-Jabbar that stands on the plaza in front of the Lakers' downtown arena.

            Sanchez shares a set of two season tickets with a few friends and family, and he already had the seats for Tuesday's game months before anyone could predict the magic day. He turned down a friend's offer of $200 to swap the Thunder seats, but he knew he would be out of luck if James waited until Thursday to break the record, since those tickets belong to a different friend.

            “It's basketball history, and that's what the Lakers are all about,” Sanchez said. “LeBron is already one of the greatest Lakers ever, and getting this record in a Lakers uniform just makes it more certain. He was our leader after Kobe (Bryant) died, and he's our leader now.”

            Indeed, James has already earned a special place in Lakers fans' hearts over his five seasons in purple and gold. Several months before he won the franchise's 17th championship in the Florida pandemic bubble, he became a part of Lakers lore with his inspirational words and steady leadership in the wake of Bryant's death in a helicopter crash.

            Inside the building, dozens of celebrities gathered to witness history: Denzel Washington, Jay-Z, Bad Bunny, LL Cool J, Usher, Andy Garcia and countless others. Dozens of basketball greats also turned out, including Lakers heroes James Worthy and Bob McAdoo along with Dwyane Wade.

            The biggest star in the crowd was Abdul-Jabbar, who has verbally sparred with James in public over issues not directly related to basketball. The Lakers legend known to all as Cap wasn't about to miss history, and he shared a warm hug with James before ceremonially exchanging a basketball in a simple, touching gesture.

            Although the final score chafed him, James said he'll never forget this stop on his two-decade journey.

            “This ride has been fantastic,” James said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803844,UN experts: North Korean hackers stole record virtual assets,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) — North Korean hackers working for the government stole record-breaking virtual assets last year estimated to be worth between $630 million and more than $1 billion, U.N. experts said in a new report.

            The panel of experts said in the wide-ranging report seen Tuesday by The Associated Press that the hackers used increasingly sophisticated techniques to gain access to digital networks involved in cyberfinance, and to steal information that could be useful in North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs from governments, individuals and companies.

            With growing tensions on the Korean Peninsula, the report said North Korea continued to violate U.N. sanctions, producing weapons-grade nuclear material, and improving its ballistic missile program, which “continued to accelerate dramatically.”











            In 2022, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea – the North’s official name – launched at least 73 ballistic missiles and missiles combining ballistic and guidance technologies including eight intercontinental ballistic missiles, the panel said. And 42 launches, including the test of a reportedly new type of ICBM and a new solid-fueled ICBM engine, were conducted in the last four months of the year. 

            North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un ordered an “exponential increase of the country’s nuclear arsenal” in January, and the panel said “a new law discussed an increased focus on tactical nuclear capability, a new first-use doctrine, and the `irreversible nature’ of the DPRK’s nuclear status.”

            “The ability to carry out an unexpected nuclear strike on any regional or international target, described in DPRK’s new law on nuclear doctrine and progressively in public statements since 2021, is consistent with the observed production, testing, and deployment of its tactical and strategic delivery systems,” the experts said in the report to the U.N. Security Council.

            The panel said that South Korean authorities quoted in media reports “estimated that state sponsored DPRK cyber threat actors had stolen virtual assets worth around $1.2 billion globally since 2017, including about $630 million in 2022 alone.”

            The experts monitoring sanctions against North Korea said an unnamed cybersecurity firm “assessed that in 2022, DPRK cybercrime yielded cyber currencies worth over $1 billion at the time of the threat, which is more than double the total proceeds in 2021.” 

            The variation in the U.S. dollar value of cryptocurrency in recent months is likely to have affected these estimates, the panel said, “but both show that 2022 was a record-breaking year for DPRK virtual asset theft.”

            The panel said three groups that are part of the Reconnaissance General Bureau, North Korea’s primary foreign intelligence organization, “continued illicitly to target victims to generate revenue and solicit information of value to the DPRK including its weapons programs” – Kimsuky, Lazarus Group and Andariel.

            Between February and July 2022, the panel said, the Lazarus Group “reportedly targeted energy providers in multiple member states using a vulnerability” to install malware and gain long-term access. It said this “aligns with historical Lazarus intrusions targeting critical infrastructure and energy companies … to siphon off proprietary intellectual property.”

            Lazarus Group’s primary focus is on specific types of industry, aerospace and defense and conventional finance and cryptocurrencies, with the objective of accessing the internal knowledge bases of the compromised companies, the experts said. They quoted the cybersecurity section of an internet technology company as saying Lazarus has been targeting engineers and technical support employees “using malicious versions of open source applications.”

            In December 2022, the panel said, South Korea’s national police agency announced that Kimsuky had targeted 892 foreign policy related experts “in an effort to steal personal data and email lists.”

            The police reported that the hackers didn’t manage to steal sensitive information, but they “laundered IP addresses of the victims and employed 326 detour servers and 26 member states to make tracing difficult,” the experts said. The police noted it was the first time they detected Kimsuky using ransomware, saying 19 servers and 13 businesses were affected, of which two paid 2.5 million South Korean won ($1,980) in Bitcoin to the hackers.

            On military-related issues, the experts said they investigated the “apparent export” of military communications equipment from a North Korean company under U.N. sanctions to Ethiopia’s defense ministry in June 2022. 

            The panel said it has not yet received a reply from Ethiopia's government about a photo published by the Ethiopian media in November allegedly showing a piece of equipment from the Global Communications Co., known as Glocom, being used by a top military official. Eritrea also hasn't responded to questions about its alleged procurement of Glocom equipment, the experts said.

            North Korea may also have illegally traded arms and related material with a number of countries, including sending artillery shells, infantry rockets and missiles to Russia – claims Pyongyang and Moscow have consistently denied, the panel said. And the experts said they are investigating the reported sale of weapons from a North Korean company on the U.N. sanctions list to the Myanmar military through a Myanmar company.UNITED NATIONS (AP) — North Korean hackers working for the government stole record-breaking virtual assets last year estimated to be worth between $630 million and more than $1 billion, U.N. experts said in a new report.The panel of experts said in the wide-ranging report seen Tuesday by The Associated Press that the hackers used increasingly sophisticated techniques to gain access to digital networks involved in cyberfinance, and to steal information that could be useful in North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs from governments, individuals and companies.With growing tensions on the Korean Peninsula, the report said North Korea continued to violate U.N. sanctions, producing weapons-grade nuclear material, and improving its ballistic missile program, which “continued to accelerate dramatically.”In 2022, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea – the North’s official name – launched at least 73 ballistic missiles and missiles combining ballistic and guidance technologies including eight intercontinental ballistic missiles, the panel said.

(AP) — Ricky Council IV scored 20 points, Anthony Black had 19 and Arkansas used a blazing second half to pull away and beat Kentucky 88-73 on Tuesday night, giving coach Eric Musselman his 200th collegiate victory.

            Black added five assists and five steals. Makhel Mitchell and Davonte Davis scored 15 points each and Jordan Walsh 13 for the Razorbacks (17-7, 6-5 SEC) who have won five straight conference games, including three in a row. It was Arkansas' third straight win over the Wildcats (16-8, 7-4). The teams meet again in Fayetteville in a regular-season finale on March 4.

            Cason Wallace scored 24 points to lead Kentucky, which had won six straight conference games. Chris Livingston added 13 points and Jacob Toppin and Antonio Reeves 11 each. 











            After a first half with 11 lead changes, there were none in the second when Arkansas shot 72% and Council and Black combined for 25 points. 

            Three steals, including two by Black who turned them into consecutive dunks, fueled an 11-3 run to begin the second half for a 52-43 lead. A basket by Black made it a double-digit lead with eight minutes left as the Razorbacks sank 7 of 9 over that span to finish the game. They made 8 of 10 free throws over the final two minutes.

            Kentucky coach John Calipari was given a technical foul with 33 seconds left in the first half. Black sank the resulting free throws for a three-point lead before Daimion Collins' midrange jumper made it 41-40 at halftime. 

            Both teams shot over 50% in the first half with Wallace leading all scorers with 11 points. Kentucky dipped under 50% for the game while Arkansas finished at 63% and outscored the Wildcats 46-28 in the paint.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803847,Scoring King: James passes Abdul-Jabbar for NBA points mark,"LeBron James got the first official statistic of his NBA career on a rebound. His next entry on the stat sheet was an assist.

            Even then, points weren’t the priority. They never were.

            Somehow, he became the most prolific scorer in NBA history anyway. It finally happened Tuesday night, the kid from Akron, Ohio, connecting on a step-back jumper to push his career total to 38,388 points and break the record that Kareem Abdul-Jabbar held for nearly 39 years.











            James outstretched his arms after his 36th point of the night for the Los Angeles Lakers, threw both hands in the air, then smiled. Abdul-Jabbar rose from his seat and clapped. The game was stopped as members of James' family, including his mother, his wife and their three children, took the floor for a ceremony recognizing the moment.

            “It’s never gotten my juices flowing,” James told The Associated Press, when asked what the scoring record means to him. “I’m there now because I never, ever thought about it. The only thing I ever thought about was winning championships, maybe a couple MVPs, maybe defensive player of the year. But scoring championships and records, I’m telling you, that was never on my mind.”

            Abdul-Jabbar — a longtime Laker and one of many celebrities and sports stars who made sure they were there to see history — became the league’s all-time leading scorer on April 5, 1984 and wound up retiring in 1989 with 38,387 points. It was a record that some thought would last forever, with very few even coming close. Karl Malone retired 1,459 points behind Abdul-Jabbar, Kobe Bryant was 4,744 points shy, and Michael Jordan was 6,095 points away.

            James passed them all, then caught Abdul-Jabbar, too. The 38-year-old — who finished with 38 points in the Lakers' 133-130 loss — did it in his 20th season. Abdul-Jabbar also played 20 NBA seasons.

            “You've got to give him credit for just the way that he planned to last and to dominate,"" Abdul-Jabbar told TNT.

            And now, King James — a moniker he’s had since high school, when he was just a kid from Akron — is the NBA’s scoring king, with 38,390 points and counting.

            “A record that has stood for nearly 40 years, which many people thought would never be broken,"" NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said.

            Abdul-Jabbar held the ball aloft, then handed it to James, the ceremonial passing of the torch. They posed for photos with Silver, then with one another. James wiped away tears from his eyes, then addressed the crowd.

            “I just want to say, thank you to the Laker faithful. You guys are one of a kind,"" James said. “To be able to be in the presence of such a legend as great as Kareem, it's very humbling. Please give a standing ovation to the Captain, please.""

            James then thanked his family and those who have supported him, including Silver and the late NBA Commissioner David Stern.

            “I thank you guys so much for allowing me to be a part of something I've always dreamed about,"" James said.

            At least 16 different players have, technically, been the all-time leading scorer in league history — most of those coming in the opening month of the league’s existence in 1946, when everybody was starting from zero and nine different players were atop the scoring list in the first 16 days.

            But only six have ended a season officially as the all-time leader: Joe Fulks, George Mikan, Dolph Schayes, Bob Pettit, Wilt Chamberlain and Abdul-Jabbar.

            James will be the seventh name on that list, and he’s likely to stay there for a long time. No active player is within 10,000 points of James, who is under contract for two more years and is on pace to become the league’s first 40,000-point scorer sometime next season.

            “Nobody will ever, ever touch it,” said Cleveland forward Kevin Love, a teammate of James on the 2016 title team. “The scoring record now will never be eclipsed. I don’t care. It will never, ever be touched. It will never happen again.”

            James could have had the scoring record long ago, if so inclined. But he always preferred passing. James is behind only John Stockton, Jason Kidd and Chris Paul on the all-time assists list. None of them were, or are, close to the scorer that James is. Of that group, Paul comes closest, ranking 38th in NBA history.

            And Paul is 17,000 points behind the new scoring king.

            “I hadn’t thought of it that way, but that is very true,” Silver told AP in advance of the record-setting night. “I think it even adds — right? — to this this accomplishment for a guy who became a scorer because he determined that’s what was necessary to win. And you’re right, he probably doesn’t get enough credit for his selfless play, because there’s so much focus and attention on him. ... I think it makes it that much more special, that he’d rather be known for his assists than his baskets.”

            James is the only member of the NBA’s triple-quintuple club: at least 10,000 points, 10,000 rebounds and 10,000 assists. There are 44 players to reach five digits in two of those categories.

            He’ll almost certainly be the NBA’s all-time leader in earnings whenever he retires; when adding in the $97 million he’ll make over the next two seasons, he’ll be past $500 million in on-court salary alone. He’s a 19-time All-Star selection, tying an Abdul-Jabbar record. If he plays in the game on Feb. 19 in Salt Lake City, he’ll set a record for appearances.

            Others, maybe, have been this good. That’s always a debate. But no one has ever been this good, for this long. James — a two-time champion in Miami, a champion in Cleveland in 2016 and a champion with the Lakers in 2020 — is averaging 30 points per game in his 20th season; only three other players have averaged more than 10 points per game this deep into their careers, none of those averaging more than Bryant’s 17.6 in his 20th and final season.

            “I never did the, ‘OK, if I play this amount of time and I average this’ thing,” James said. “I’ve never done that with anything in my career. I always said, ‘If it happens, it happens.’”

            It happened.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803848,New Zealand's new leader Hipkins cuts many contentious plans,"WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — New Zealand's new Prime Minister Chris Hipkins on Wednesday said he was axing or delaying many of his government's more contentious policy plans as he looked to refocus on priorities like the rising cost of living.

            Hipkins, who was sworn in two weeks ago after the shock resignation of Jacinda Ardern, said his government had been trying to do too much, too fast.

            Among the plans he has dropped or delayed is legislation that would have outlawed hate speech against religious groups in the wake of the deadly 2019 mosque shootings, a plan to merge the nation's public television and radio broadcasters, a new insurance scheme to help laid-off workers, and a mandate for fuel suppliers to increase their use of biofuels and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.











            “These are the first and the most significant set of decisions that we are taking to refocus the government's agenda,” Hipkins said. “They'll allow us to shift our focus, our time, our energy and our resources to the most pressing issues that are facing New Zealanders at the moment. They won't be the last policy changes we'll be making.”

            Among criticisms of the plans were that the hate speech bill would have impinged on free speech, the broadcasting merger was unnecessary, the insurance scheme would have been expensive for employers and workers, and the fuel mandate would have raised the cost of gas.

            Hipkins said the government was continuing to take a hard look at other contentious plans, which include the government taking more control of water infrastructure, building light rail connections in Auckland, and taxing the greenhouse gas emissions of farm animals.

            Hipkins also announced a 7% increase in the minimum wage, to 22.70 New Zealand dollars ($14.40) per hour. 

            Hipkins faces a general election in just over eight months. After Ardern won the last election in a landslide, her popularity faded and opinion polls put her Labour Party behind its main conservative rival, the National Party. Polls indicate the Labour Party has gotten an initial boost in support since Hipkins took the reins.

            Before she resigned, Ardern had said she planned this year to refocus some of the government's priorities. 

            But the sweeping nature of the reset by Hipkins took some observers by surprise. Hipkins said the changes could save hundreds of millions of dollars. He said many of the plans remained good ideas but the time wasn't right to implement them.

            Taxpayer groups applauded the measures, while environmentalists said the country was in danger of stepping away from its commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

            Opposition Leader Christopher Luxon said the government was merely putting many of its plans on hold for another day.

            “They’re still obsessed with ideological pet projects, they still have no plan to reduce the cost of living, and they are still addicted to wasteful spending,” Luxon said.WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — New Zealand's new Prime Minister Chris Hipkins on Wednesday said he was axing or delaying many of his government's more contentious policy plans as he looked to refocus on priorities like the rising cost of living.Hipkins, who was sworn in two weeks ago after the shock resignation of Jacinda Ardern, said his government had been trying to do too much, too fast.Among the plans he has dropped or delayed is legislation that would have outlawed hate speech against religious groups in the wake of the deadly 2019 mosque shootings, a plan to merge the nation's public television and radio broadcasters, a new insurance scheme to help laid-off workers, and a mandate for fuel suppliers to increase their use of biofuels and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.“These are the first and the most significant set of decisions that we are taking to refocus the government's agenda,” Hipkins said. “They'll allow us to shift our focus, our time, our energy and our resources to the most pressing issues that are facing New Zealanders at the moment.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803849,"Landowner help sought to protect endangered animals, plants","TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. (AP) — The Biden administration called for regulatory changes Wednesday to encourage voluntary conservation projects on private land, partly by shielding owners from punishment if their actions kill or harm small numbers of imperiled species.

            The proposed U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service rule outlines steps to simplify permitting for damage that otherwise would be illegal under the Endangered Species Act. The Associated Press obtained details on the proposal prior to its public release.

            To qualify, landowners take steps that would benefit declining species, including pollinators such as bumblebees and monarch butterflies.











            The idea is to make landowners allies rather than adversaries as climate change, urban sprawl and other trends jeopardize more animals and plants. The United Nations says up to 1 million species could go extinct worldwide, many in the next few decades.

            Preventing such losses will require protections on both private and public lands, officials told AP.

            “We believe very strongly that collaborative conservation is the way forward,” U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said in an interview. She added in a statement that partnerships would “set us on a course for continued recovery and resilience.”

            The proposed rule involves a section of the federal law that offers exceptions to its broad prohibitions on harming species listed as endangered or threatened. It allows “taking” — killing — individual plants or animals for scientific purposes, or to preserve a species through steps such as establishing new populations.

            It also allows such harm if it's an unintended result of an otherwise legal activity such as logging, mining and oil and gas development.

            Killing or harming members of listed species under those circumstances requires a permit, accompanied by plans for limiting the damage and conserving the species overall.

            “These are tools that are valuable and popular, but are largely constrained by the fact that they are time consuming and expensive to negotiate,” said Jonathan Wood, a vice president at the Property and Environment Research Center, which supports a free-market approach to environmentalism.

            The proposed new rule is designed to make reaching such deals easier and get more landowners to take part.

            It would combine two existing types of protection agreements into one. It also would allow owners eventually to stop their protection measures — for example, by cutting trees they had allowed to grow for the benefit of woodland species such as birds or bats.

            Another provision would allow issuance of permits for harming individuals of species that haven't been listed as endangered or threatened but could be in the future. The landowner would begin protective measures immediately but couldn't hurt or kill any of the animals or plants until their species are listed. That could help them recover well enough that legal protections aren't needed.

            ""We anticipate that these improvements will encourage more individuals and companies to engage in these voluntary programs, thereby generating greater conservation results overall,” the Fish and Wildlife Service said in a regulatory filing.

            Environmental law experts said the strategy is worth trying but success isn't certain — particularly since it opens the door to more “incidental” deaths and gives landowners the option of dropping conservation efforts.

            “This is not a risk-free rule,” said Pat Parenteau, an emeritus law professor at the Vermont Law and Graduate School. “It may not work out to the net benefit of the species in question.”

            Most endangered species live largely on private land, so the government has little choice but to seek voluntary cooperation, accept tradeoffs and assure owners they'll be able to manage their property, said Dan Rohlf, a professor with the Lewis and Clark Law School in Portland, Oregon.

            But an agreement that doesn't require permanent conservation measures “sends a message to non-federal landowners that species conservation is ultimately not your obligation,” Rohlf said. “It says that hopefully we'll recover a species somewhere else than your land. And that may or may not be true or possible.""

            Wildlife advocates have criticized the use of conservation agreements in cases including Arctic grayling, a fish struggling to survive in parts of Montana.

            Advocates sued the government last week, contending a deal reached more than a decade ago involving the Big Hole River and its tributaries — home to the grayling and a water source for agriculture — had failed to stop the fish's decline.

            The agreement wasn't enforceable and didn't go through a public process so experts could weigh in, said Kristine Akland, an attorney with the Center for Biological Diversity.

            “The concept is great: State and private entities and the federal government all come together and agree to abide by certain measures to help a species,” Akland said. “Every ... conservation agreement is going to be subject to those pitfalls.”

            The Fish and Wildlife Service scheduled a public comment period for Feb. 9 through April 10. No date has been set for a final decision on the proposed rule.

            The service invited feedback on matters such as whether the proposed changes would save time and money; how they would affect conservation; how much private land could be eligible; and the potential for more permit applications.

            “The upcoming rule is important to bring in the nonfederal landowners, to bring working landscapes into this partnership of really embracing the Endangered Species Act,” Martha Williams, director of the Fish and Wildlife Service, told AP.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803862,"Turkey, Syria quake deaths pass 9,500; deadliest in decade","GAZIANTEP, Turkey (AP) — Thinly stretched rescue teams worked through the night in Turkey and Syria, pulling more bodies from the rubble of thousands of buildings toppled by a catastrophic earthquake. The death toll rose Wednesday to more than 9,500, making the quake the deadliest in more than a decade.That makes it the deadliest since a 2011 earthquake in Japan triggered a tsunami, killing nearly 20,000 people.Amid calls for the government to send more help to the disaster zone, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was to travel to town of Pazarcik, the epicenter of the quake, and to the worst-hit province of Hatay on Wednesday.Turkey now has some 60,000 aid personnel in the quake-hit zone, but with the devastation so widespread many are still waiting for help.Nearly two days after the magnitude 7.8 quake struck southeastern Turkey and northern Syria, rescuers pulled a 3-year-old boy, Arif Kaan, from beneath the rubble of a collapsed apartment building in Kahramanmaras, a city not far from the epicenter.With the boy's lower body trapped under slabs of concrete and twisted rebar, emergency crews lay a blanket over his torso to protect him from below-freezing temperatures as they carefully cut the debris away from him, mindful of the possibility of triggering another collapse.The boy's father, Ertugrul Kisi, who himself had been rescued earlier, sobbed as his son was pulled free and loaded into an ambulance.“For now, the name of hope in Kahramanmaras is Arif Kaan,” a Turkish television reporter proclaimed as the dramatic rescue was broadcast to the country.A few hours later, rescuers pulled 10-year-old Betul Edis from the rubble of her home in the city of Adiyaman. Amid applause from onlookers, her grandfather kissed her and spoke softly to her as she was loaded on an ambulance.But such stories were few more than two days after Monday's pre-dawn earthquake, which hit a huge area and brought down thousands of buildings, with frigid temperatures and ongoing aftershocks complicating rescue efforts.Search teams from more than two dozen countries joined the Turkish emergency personnel, and aid pledges poured in.But with devastation spread multiple several cities and towns — some isolated by Syria’s ongoing conflict — voices crying from within mounds of rubble fell silent, and despair grew from those still waiting for help.In Syria, the shaking toppled thousands of buildings and heaped more misery on a region wracked by the country's 12-year civil war and refugee crisis.On Monday afternoon in a northwestern Syrian town, residents found a crying newborn still connected by the umbilical cord to her deceased mother. The baby was the only member of her family to survive a building collapse in the small town of Jinderis, relatives told The Associated Press.Turkey is home to millions of refugees from the war. The affected area in Syria is divided between government-controlled territory and the country’s last opposition-held enclave, where millions rely on humanitarian aid.As many as 23 million people could be affected in the quake-hit region, according to Adelheid Marschang, a senior emergencies officer with the World Health Organization, who called it a “crisis on top of multiple crises.”Many survivors in Turkey have had to sleep in cars, outside or in government shelters.“We don’t have a tent, we don’t have a heating stove, we don’t have anything. Our children are in bad shape. We are all getting wet under the rain and our kids are out in the cold,” Aysan Kurt, 27, told the AP. “We did not die from hunger or the earthquake, but we will die freezing from the cold.”Erdogan said 13 million of the country's 85 million people were affected, and he declared a state of emergency in 10 provinces. More than 8,000 people have been pulled from the debris in Turkey, and some 380,000 have taken refuge in government shelters or hotels, authorities said.Turkey’s disaster management agency said the country’s death toll had risen to 7,108, bringing the overall total to 9,638, including fatalities reported in neighboring Syria, since Monday’s earthquake and multiple aftershocks. Another 40,910 people have been injured.The death toll in government-held areas of Syria has climbed to 1,250, with 2,054 injured, according to the Health Ministry. At least 1,280 people have died in the rebel-held northwest, according to volunteer first responders known as the White Helmets, with more than 2,600 injured.In Syria, aid efforts have been hampered by the ongoing war and the isolation of the rebel-held region along the border, which is surrounded by Russia-backed government forces. Syria itself is an international pariah under Western sanctions linked to the war.The United Nations said it was “exploring all avenues” to get supplies to the rebel-held northwest.The region sits on top of major fault lines and is frequently shaken by earthquakes. Some 18,000 were killed in similarly powerful earthquakes that hit northwest Turkey in 1999.___Alsayed reported from Bab al-Hawa, Syria. Fraser reported from Ankara, Turkey.

Pakistani Taliban have waged an insurgency in Pakistan in the past 15 years, seeking stricter enforcement of Islamic laws, the release of its members in government custody and a reduction in the Pakistani military presence in areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province it has long used as its base.Pakistani Taliban, most of whom are hiding in Afghanistan, have been emboldened since the Afghan Taliban seized power in Afghanistan in August 2021 as U.S. and NATO troops pulled out of the country after 20 years of war.",2023/2/8,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803895,Texas man pleads guilty in racist 2019 Walmart attack,"EL PASO, Texas (AP) — A Texas man pleaded guilty Wednesday to federal hate crime and weapons charges in the racist attack at an El Paso Walmart in 2019, which prosecutors say was preceded by the gunman posting an online screed that warned of a “Hispanic invasion.""

            Patrick Crusius, 24, showed little emotion while shackled in an El Paso courtroom just a few miles from the store where he was accused of killing 23 people, including citizens of Mexico, in what remains one of the worst mass shootings in U.S. history.

            Sentencing is not scheduled until later this year, but the U.S. government had previously announced it wouldn’t seek the death penalty. Crusius waived most of his rights to appeal on a total of 90 federal charges, which U.S. District Judge David Guaderrama said would each carry a life sentence.











            “I plead guilty,” he said.

            Crusius had originally pleaded not guilty before federal prosecutors took the death penalty off the table. He could still receive the death penalty, however, under separate state capital murder charges in Texas, although it remains unclear when that case might go to trial.

            Albert Hernandez, whose sister and brother-in-law were killed in the attack, was one of about 40 people with close ties to the victims in the court gallery. He called Crusius a coward who was trying to “save his own skin” by pleading guilty in federal court.

            “This guy knew what he was doing. It was premeditated,” Hernandez said of the shooting. ""He came here to take care of business.”

            Crusius surrendered to police after the massacre, saying, “I’m the shooter, ” and that he was targeting Mexicans, according to court records. Prosecutors have said he drove more than 10 hours from his hometown near Dallas to the largely Latino border city and published a document online shortly before the shooting that said it was “in response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas.”

            The Aug. 3, 2019, shooting happened on a busy weekend at a Walmart that is typically popular with shoppers from Mexico and the U.S. In addition to those killed, more than two dozen were injured and hundreds more were scarred by being present or having a loved-one hurt. 

            Prosecutors presented a detailed narrative of the attack during Wednesday's plea hearing, describing how it began with a pedestrian gunned down in the parking lot before Crusius, wearing earmuffs that mute the sound of gunfire, opened fire at people at a fundraiser for a soccer team. 

            As Crusius moved inside the store, prosecutors said, nine people were cornered and shot to death at a bank near the entrance. Among them were husband and wife Jordan and Andre Anchondo, whose infant son survived with broken bones in a hand.

            It's also where gunfire cut down Margie Reckard, whose August 2019 funeral drew thousands of sympathizers from as far away as California and across the border in Mexico — after her husband announced that he was alone with almost no family left and invited the world to attend.

            The killing continued as Crusius fired his assault rifle down multiple aisles, according to prosecutors. Exiting Walmart, he fired on a passing car, killing and elderly man and wounding his wife.

            Former El Paso Mayor Dee Margo attended the plea hearing and called it a “gut-wrencher.” 

            “We have an evil white supremacist who showed up and attacked us for who we are,"" he said.

            After the hearing, defense attorney Joe Spencer said Crusius wanted to accept responsibility. “There are no winners in this case,” he said.

            Prosecutors say Crusius consented after surrendering to two videotaped interviews with detectives and the FBI on Aug. 3 and providing two thumb drives that containing his racist writings and other records.

            Crusius' writings before the shooting echoed both the anti-immigration rhetoric of American politics and racist screeds put out by other mass shooters in the U.S. and abroad.

            More than three years after the shooting, the description of an “invasion” on the U.S.-Mexico border has continued in American politics. Critics have condemned the characterization as anti-immigrant and dangerous in the aftermath of El Paso and other racially motivated attacks. 

            Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, has recently embraced using the word “invasion” while authorizing a series of hardline immigration measures. In November, Abbott sent a letter to state police and the Texas National Guard with the subject line “Defend Texas Against Invasion."" 

            Abbott has defended his statements by saying he is invoking language included in the U.S. Constitution. Some legal scholars have called it a misreading of the clause. 

            “If this is not an invasion, what is it?"" Abbott asked CNN's Jake Tapper during an interview last month. ""Think about the volume of people coming across the border."" 

            America's Voice, an immigration reform group, said it tracked more than 80 Republican candidates during last year's midterm elections who amplified what they called “invasion” and “replacement” conspiracies.

            “I think it’s been creeping over the years,” said Zachary Mueller, political director of America's Voice. ""What I would say is that in 2021, there was a marked shift where it went from the fringes of the Republican Party into the mainstream of the Republican Party.” 

            A database of mass killings in the U.S. since 2006 compiled by The Associated Press, USA Today and Northeastern University shows that the number of deadly mass shootings linked to hate crimes has increased in recent years. Among 13 prominent instances, the 2019 Walmart shooting was the deadliest. The database tracks every mass killing — defined as four dead, not including the offender — in the U.S. since 2006.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803896,Taiwan opposition leader in China as Beijing ups pressure,"BEIJING (AP) — The vice chair of Beijing-friendly opposition Nationalist Party from Taiwan was visiting China for meetings with officials and the local business community, drawing criticism from the self-governing island's ruling party. 

            Andrew Hsia’s nine-day trip starting Wednesday comes as China renews attacks on the ruling Democratic Progressive Party over its refusal to recognize Taiwan as a part of China. 

            Spokesperson for the Chinese Cabinet’s Taiwan Affairs Office Zhu Fenglian accused the DPP of acting “out of selfish political interest” in seeking the island’s formal independence with foreign support. 











            
                Tensions between China and Taiwan have increased following a stream of visits by foreign parliamentarians and others to the island, including a possible upcoming trip by U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. 

            In August, China fired missiles and held threatening war games around Taiwan in response to a visit by then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who became the most senior U.S. official to visit Taiwan in 25 years. 

            Those actions “damage the Taiwan compatriots’ interests and well-being, endangers their safety and security, and gradually push Taiwan to a dangerous stage,"" Zhu said, in a reference to China's threat to use force to recover what it considers Chinese territory. 

            The sides split amid civil war in 1949, and Taiwan has never been governed by China's ruling Communist Party. 

            Despite their close economic ties, China has refused all contact with Taiwan's government since President Tsai Ing-wen first took office in 2016 over her refusal to recognize the concept of “one-China"" embodied in an earlier agreement brokered by the Nationalists and mainland Communists known as the “'92 Consensus."" 

            In contrast, Zhu said China welcomed Hsia's visit, saying Beijing is “willing to strengthen exchanges with the Nationalists, consolidate and enhance mutual trust, and deepen exchanges and cooperation in various fields on the common political foundation of adhering to the '92 Consensus and opposing Taiwan independence."" 

            The vast majority of Taiwan's 23 million people support the status quo of de-facto independence and Tsai says there is no need to make a formal declaration that would likely spark a military response from China. 

            Hsia plans to visit several major Chinese cities and meet with head of the Taiwan Affairs Office, Song Tao, the Nationalists said. His meetings with the business community will focus on restoring air and sea links between the sides that were suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

            The DPP criticized the trip, saying Monday that it would lead to “unnecessary speculation” internationally, Taiwan's official Central News Agency reported. 

            Hsia should not sacrifice Taiwan’s interests while “rushing to demonstrate loyalty to China,” the DPP said. 

            The visit also comes amid a new downturn in relations between China and the U.S., Taiwan's chief backer, over the presence of a suspected Chinese spy balloon in American airspace. 

            The U.S. military shot down the unmanned airship on Saturday and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken canceled his visit to Beijing, prompting angry complaints from China over what it called an overreaction.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803897,LeBron sets NBA career scoring mark in Lakers' loss to OKC,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — LeBron James became the NBA's career scoring leader on a step-back jumper late in the third quarter, passing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's record during his 38-point performance in the Los Angeles Lakers' 133-130 loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder on Tuesday night.

            James surpassed the mark held since April 1984 by Abdul-Jabbar, who watched the game from a baseline seat near the Lakers' bench. Abdul-Jabbar then joined a clearly emotional James and NBA Commissioner Adam Silver on the court after the historic basket.

            James' mother, wife and children also sat courtside amid a celebrity-studded crowd that rose in waves of anticipation nearly every time he touched the ball.











            James didn't let them down: After scoring 20 points in the first half with a full showcase of the offensive talent that still shines blindingly after two decades in the NBA, he set the new record with a 16-point third quarter capped by that pretty jumper.

            “I didn’t set this as a goal, so that’s probably why it’s so surreal and so weird to me,” James said. “I never talked about being the all-time scorer in NBA history … until my numbers started getting closer and closer, and I was like, ‘Oh wow, this is crazy. This is weird, but I guess I’m doing it.’”

            The game was stopped for about 10 minutes while James hugged his family and participated in a brief ceremony with Silver and Abdul-Jabbar. James said he almost never cries, but he acknowledged the tears in his eyes.

            “I just want to say thank you to the Laker faithful,"" James said. “You guys are one of a kind. To be able to be in the presence of such a legend as great as Kareem, it’s very humbling.”

            James has five 40-point games since turning 38 on Dec. 30, and he has scored 30 points in 10 of his 17 games since his birthday. But he scored only two points in the fourth quarter, putting him atop the career scoring list with 38,390 points — three ahead of Abdul-Jabbar. 

            “That was a great feeling, a great moment,” said teammate Anthony Davis, who managed just 13 points. “Well deserved to a guy who puts in so much work on and off the floor. It’s a real moment. Everybody was very happy for him.”

            While James hit his mark, the Lakers took another discouraging loss in their attempt to avoid the humiliation of missing the playoffs for a second straight season.

            Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 30 points and Jalen Williams had 25 for the Thunder. Oklahoma City never trailed in the second half, holding off the Lakers' 14-4 rally in the final two minutes.

            “It was a blessing and an honor to be a part of it,” Lakers coach Darvin Ham said. “He gave the people what they wanted, in true LeBron fashion. ... It (stinks) we didn’t get the win on a night like this, but there’s a lot of things to pull from it, a lot of things to take away.”

            The young Thunder appeared to feed off the energy created by James' momentous night, even if they couldn't guard him much. Oklahoma City jumped to a 15-point lead in the first half and hit nearly 60% of its shots.

            Oklahoma City moved 1 1/2 games ahead of the 13th-place Lakers (25-30) near the bottom of the Western Conference standings.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803898,New Zealand police find 3.5 tons of cocaine in Pacific Ocean,"WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — New Zealand police said Wednesday they found more than 3 tons of cocaine floating in a remote part of the Pacific Ocean after it was dropped there by an international drug-smuggling syndicate.

            While they had yet to make any arrests, police said they had dealt a financial blow to everyone from the South American producers of the drugs through to the distributors in what was the nation's largest-ever drug seizure. 

            New Zealand Police Commissioner Andrew Coster said the cocaine had been dropped at a floating transit point in 81 bales before it was intercepted by a navy ship, which was deployed to the area last week. The ship then made the six-day trip back to New Zealand, where the drugs were being documented and destroyed.











            Coster said the wholesale value of the 3.2 tonnes (3.5 tons) of cocaine was about 500 million New Zealand dollars ($316 million) and it was likely destined for Australia.

            “We believe there was enough cocaine to service the Australian market for about one year, and this would be more than New Zealand would use in 30 years,” Coster said.

            He said police, customs and the military found the drugs after launching Operation Hydros in December in collaboration with international partner agencies to identify and monitor the movements of suspicious vessels.

            Coster said they were continuing to investigate the case with other international agencies. 

            Bill Perry, the acting comptroller of the New Zealand Customs Service, said the haul illustrated the lengths that organized syndicates were going to in order to smuggle drugs in the South Pacific.

            “We see perhaps this is just an indication that the transnational organized crime groups are testing the market in different ways, so as agencies, we need to collaborate,"" Perry said.WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — New Zealand police said Wednesday they found more than 3 tons of cocaine floating in a remote part of the Pacific Ocean after it was dropped there by an international drug-smuggling syndicate.While they had yet to make any arrests, police said they had dealt a financial blow to everyone from the South American producers of the drugs through to the distributors in what was the nation's largest-ever drug seizure.New Zealand Police Commissioner Andrew Coster said the cocaine had been dropped at a floating transit point in 81 bales before it was intercepted by a navy ship, which was deployed to the area last week.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803900,Taiwan exports drop for 5th consecutive month in January,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwan’s exports dropped for the fifth consecutive month in January amid sluggish global demand and the extended Lunar New Year break.

            January exports plunged 21.2% year-on-year to US$31.51 billion (NT$944 billion), the Ministry of Finance (MOF) said on Tuesday (Feb. 7). This followed a 12.1% drop in December, according to MOF statistics.

            Meanwhile, imports last month fell 16.6% compared to a year earlier to US$29.17 billion, leaving Taiwan with a trade surplus of US$2.34 billion for January. Electronic component shipments plunged 20.1% to US$12.72 billion for the first month of the year, while chip exports dropped 18.3% year-over-year, according to Reuters.

            Exports to China, which accounted for 33.1% of Jan. exports, fell 33.5% year-on-year to US$10.44 billion. Shipments to the U.S., which made up 17% of last month’s exports, dropped 14.5% to US$5.36 billion, according to MOF data.











            The MOF said seasonally lower demand around the world following the holiday period and fewer working days in Taiwan because of the Lunar New Year holiday affected exports, per Reuters. Looking ahead, the ministry said ongoing monetary policy tightening in developed economies will affect overall demand, in addition to the war in Ukraine and U.S.-China trade tensions.

            “It will not be easy to recover significantly in the short term,” Reuters cited the MOF as saying, while it forecasted Feb. exports could drop 7-11% from a year earlier, and decline about 10% for the first quarter.TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwan’s exports dropped for the fifth consecutive month in January amid sluggish global demand and the extended Lunar New Year break.January exports plunged 21.2% year-on-year to US$31.51 billion (NT$944 billion), the Ministry of Finance (MOF) said on Tuesday (Feb. 7).

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803913,IEA: Asia set to use half of world's electricity by 2025,"BERLIN (AP) — Asia will for the first time use half of the world’s electricity by 2025, even as Africa continues to consume far less than its share of the global population, according to a new forecast released Wednesday by the International Energy Agency.

            Much of Asia's electricity use will be in China, a nation of 1.4 billion people whose share of global consumption will rise from a quarter in 2015 to a third by the middle of this decade, the Paris-based body said.

            “China will be consuming more electricity than the European Union, United States and India combined,” said Keisuke Sadamori, the IEA’s director of energy markets and security.











            By contrast, Africa — home to almost a fifth of world's nearly 8 billion inhabitants — will account for just 3% of global electricity consumption in 2025.

            ""This and the rapidly growing population mean there is still a massive need for increased electrification in Africa,” said Sadamori.

            The IEA's annual report predicts that nuclear power and renewables such as wind and solar will account for much of the growth in global electricity supply over the coming three years. This will prevent a significant rise in greenhouse gas emissions from the power sector, it said.

            Scientists say sharp cuts in all sources of emissions are needed as soon as possible to keep average global temperatures from rising 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels. That target, laid down in the 2015 Paris climate accord, appears increasingly doubtful as temperatures have already increased by more than 1.1 C since the reference period.

            One hope for meeting the goal is a wholesale shift away from fossil fuels such as coal, gas and oil toward low-carbon sources of energy. But while some regions are reducing their use of coal and gas for electricity production, in others consumption is increasing, the IEA said.

            The 134-page also report warned that electricity demand and supply are becoming increasingly weather dependent, a problem it urged policymakers to address.

            “In addition to drought in Europe, there were heat waves in India (last year),"" said Sadamori. “Similarly, central and eastern China were hit by heat waves and drought. The United States also saw severe winter storms in December, and all those events put massive strain on the power systems of these regions.”

            “As the clean energy transition gathers pace, the impact of weather events on electricity demand will intensify due to the increased electrification of heating, while the share of weather-dependent renewables will continue to grow in the generation mix,” the IEA said. “In such a world, increasing the flexibility of power systems while ensuring security of supply and resilience of networks will be crucial.""BERLIN (AP) — Asia will for the first time use half of the world’s electricity by 2025, even as Africa continues to consume far less than its share of the global population, according to a new forecast released Wednesday by the International Energy Agency.Much of Asia's electricity use will be in China, a nation of 1.4 billion people whose share of global consumption will rise from a quarter in 2015 to a third by the middle of this decade, the Paris-based body said.“China will be consuming more electricity than the European Union, United States and India combined,” said Keisuke Sadamori, the IEA’s director of energy markets and security.By contrast, Africa — home to almost a fifth of world's nearly 8 billion inhabitants — will account for just 3% of global electricity consumption in 2025.""This and the rapidly growing population mean there is still a massive need for increased electrification in Africa,” said Sadamori.The IEA's annual report predicts that nuclear power and renewables such as wind and solar will account for much of the growth in global electricity supply over the coming three years.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803914,"Tokyo Olympic official, 3 others held in bid-rigging probe","TOKYO (AP) — A senior official with the Tokyo Olympic organizing committee and three company executives were arrested Wednesday in an ongoing bid-rigging scandal related to the Games. 

            Yasuo Mori, the Olympic official, was arrested along with Koji Henmi, who headed the sports division at Japanese advertising giant Dentsu. Two other business executives were also arrested on charges of violating anti-monopoly laws, the Tokyo District Prosecutors said in a statement.

            Prosecutors have also been investigating a separate bribery scandal centered around former Dentsu executive Haruyuki Takahashi, who was a member of the organizing committee. 











            The bid-rigging probe in general involves the choice of venues for Olympic test events as well as for the actual Games. It is a joint operation of the Japan Fair Trade Commission, which looks at violations of anti-monopoly laws. 

            Prosecutors said the officials secretly agreed on the bids in 2018. 

            Some of the contracts had only one bidder, according to Japanese media reports. Prosecutors say the bid-rigging scandal arrests have just begun and could embroil more companies. 

            Upon conviction of violation of anti-monopoly laws, individuals can be sentenced to up to five years in prison. 

            The sprawling corruption allegations surrounding Tokyo have caused the bid by the northern Japanese city of Sapporo for the 2030 Winter Games to be placed “on hold.” Sapporo was considered the favorite before the scandal.

            Salt Lake City is the only other known bidder that might consider taking 2030. Salt Lake officials have said they favor a bid for 2034.

            The Tokyo Games were postponed for a year and held in 2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The official price tag is $13 billion, though a government audit suggests it might be twice that much. 

            Takahashi and officials at several other companies were earlier arrested in the bribery scandal. Plans for those trials are beginning. Takahashi was released on bail after being held for several months.

            Among the companies embroiled in the scandal involving Takahashi are Aoki Holdings, a clothing company that dressed Japan’s Olympic team; Sun Arrow, which produced the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic mascots named Miraitowa and Someity; and Kadokawa Group, the publisher of the Games program and guidebooks.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803932,Is Taiwan experiencing another egg shortage?,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Some consumers may have noticed that their local supermarkets and a few traditional markets were out of eggs on Feb. 5, sparking fears of another egg shortage similar to one experienced last year.Back in 2022, there was an outbreak of avian flu which throttled the supply of domestic eggs. Furthermore, the egg production industry was already brittle due to higher feed prices caused by supply chain disruptions due to COVID.According to a recent UDN report, the main culprit behind this year's egg shortage is much the same as it was a year ago. Namely, winter weather causes hens to become more prone to the flu. With many hens sickened, leading to molting or loss of feathers, mass culls have been in the works at farms in southern and central Taiwan.But Taiwan’s Council of Agriculture said there is little to worry about as the avian flu outbreak is largely under control and contained at just a few farms. Furthermore, it added that retail-grade washed eggs have been restocked at most stores though wholesale channels remain relatively tight.Meanwhile, in the U.K. and U.S., many consumers continue to face empty shelves where they used to find a variety of eggs. Egg producers have not been able to get back on track after repeated avian flu epidemics and higher costs associated with feed. In Japan, consumers have had to endure price hikes.Coincidentally, Lunar New Year is also the time when poultry farmers begin to retire old hens with younger replacements. Eggs produced by older hens are typically of lower quality and not sent for the cleaning and washing that is required for the consumer retail market.Instead, they are delivered in big batches to large companies like bakeries, according to Animal Husbandry Department Deputy Director Chiang Wen-chuan (江文全). He believes that current supply problems are associated with a transition from older hens to younger hens who will soon make up for the current egg shortage.According to information released by the Council of Agriculture, current daily egg production in Taiwan is about 116,000 to 117,000 boxes (200 eggs per box). Following the Lunar New Year, demand for eggs has been estimated to be about 118,000 to 120,000 boxes per day, leaving a shortage of about 1,000 to 2,000 boxes.A UDN reporter who visited a number of hypermarkets and supermarkets said the supply of low-cost eggs priced at about NT$60 (US$2) per dozen did not seem to be lacking. A clerk at Carrefour said there were fewer eggs and restocking was taking place as soon as the eggs arrived. A similar situation was also occurring at PX Mart.For the time being, Taiwan's egg supply may find itself at an uneasy balancing point. It will be up to consumers and middlemen to refrain from practices such as hoarding and price gouging to ensure that the public will not need to scramble to find a stable, affordable supply of fresh eggs.",2023/2/8,2627,Opinion

Green hydrogen production and sourcing opportunities will also be identified and developed to support the TEN-T Core and Comprehensive Networks for the broad-based use of zero emission LCVs. The Company's hydrogen-as-a-service model plans to provide zero-emission ecosystem solutions that will benefit from the EU's move to decarbonize.   Balraj Mann, Chairman & CEO of First Hydrogen Corp., said: ""The European Union needed to match the subsidies made by the United States and China. The proposed Green Deal Industrial Plan will provide more support of manufacturing for net-zero products, such as our light-commercial vehicle and green hydrogen service thru faster access to funding and simpler regulatory frameworks.""   Robert Campbell, CEO of First Hydrogen Energy, said: ""The European Green Deal announced in 2019, set the goal of making Europe the first climate-neutral continent by 2050. The new Green Deal Industrial Plan will allow the EU to stay competitive with other countries which have green subsidies in place. We anticipate an overall acceleration of decarbonization initiatives in Europe with this bold plan set forth by the European Union.""   The Company is also pleased to announce that it has entered into an amendment agreement (the ""Amendment Agreement"") dated February 2, 2023, to amend the terms of its Engagement Agreement with Canaccord Genuity Corp.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803954,"Asian shares mostly lower, tracking Wall Street retreat","BANGKOK (AP) — Shares fell Thursday in Asia after Wall Street gave back some of its recent gains on persisting uncertainty over interest rates and inflation. 

            Benchmarks declined in Tokyo, Seoul and Sydney but rose in Hong Kong and Shanghai. 

            Wall Street retreated Wednesday following a set of mixed earnings reports. The pullback also followed comments Tuesday by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who signaled that an exceptionally strong U.S. jobs report last Friday would not oblige the central bank to return to a more aggressive stance on raising interest rates to tame inflation.











            Another Fed official, John Williams, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said Wednesday that he still thinks the Fed’s main interest rate hitting a target of 5% to 5.5% by the end of the year is “a very reasonable view.” The federal funds rate is now at a range of 4.50% to 4.75%. Williams spoke at a CFO Network summit hosted by the Wall Street Journal.

            “Traders are keeping a close eye on policymakers’ remarks to position accordingly ahead of key upcoming inflation figures and job market data before next month’s rate decision,"" Anderson Alves of ActivTrades said in a commentary. 

            Tokyo's Nikkei 225 fell 0.4% to 27,510.17 and the Kospi in Seoul lost 0.1% to 2,482.03. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 declined 0.6% to 7,487.30. Shares also fell in Bangkok, Taiwan and Singapore. 

            Hong Kong's Hang Seng index gained 0.3% to 21,352.10, while the Shanghai Composite index advanced 0.6% to 3,252.02. 

            On Wednesday, the S&P 500 fell 1.1% to 4,117.86 and the Nasdaq fell 1.7% to 11,910.52. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gave back 0.6% to 33,949.01. 

            The Fed has been saying that it plans to hike interest rates a couple more times and then hold them at a high level at least through the end of the year. Williams warned that interest rates may need to go higher if stock prices rally and bond yields fall too much, among other loosening financial conditions, because that could drive inflation higher.

            Companies have so far been reporting relatively lackluster earnings for the last three months of 2022, as rising costs eat into their margins.

            Entertainment giant Walt Disney rose 5.5% in afterhours trading after it reported surprisingly good fiscal first-quarter financial results, but it gave up nearly all of that gain after it said it will cut about 7,000 jobs as part of a “significant transformation” announced by CEO Bob Iger. The job cuts amount to about 3% of the entertainment giant’s global workforce.

            Chipotle Mexican Grill fell 5% after it reported weaker profit and revenue for the latest quarter than Wall Street expected. 

            Jack Henry & Associates, a company in the financial technology industry, sank 9.3% for one of the biggest drops in the S&P 500 after it reported weaker results than expected and trimmed financial forecasts for the full fiscal year. 

            Lumen Technologies tumbled 20.8% despite reporting stronger results than expected. Its forecasts for some financial measures in 2023 fell short of analysts' expectations. 

            On the winning side was CVS Health, which gained 3.5% after topping Wall Street’s forecasts for revenue and profit. It also said it would buy Oak Street Health, a primary care company, in a deal it valued at about $10.6 billion.

            U.S. benchmark crude oil shed 6 cents to $78.41 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It added $1.33 on Wednesday to $78.47. 

            Brent crude, the pricing basis for international trading, also gave up 6 cents to $85.03 per barrel. 

            The U.S. dollar slipped to 131.38 Japanese yen from 131.42 yen. The euro rose to $1.0732 from $1.0742.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803955,Disney cuts Simpsons 'forced labor' episode in Hong Kong,"HONG KONG (AP) — Walt Disney Co. has removed an episode from cartoon series The Simpsons that included a reference to “forced labor camps” in China from its streaming service in Hong Kong.

            The company declined to comment on why the episode, “One Angry Lisa” from The Simpsons’ 34th season, was not available to stream on the Disney Plus streaming service in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory, according to checks by The Associated Press. 

            The episode first aired on television in October and it was not clear when the episode was removed from the Hong Kong streaming service. 











            In the episode, Simpsons character Marge Simpson takes a virtual spin class whose instructor is in front of a virtual background of the Great Wall of China and says: “Behold the wonders of China. Bitcoin mines, forced labor camps where children make smartphones.”

            The issue of forced labor is sensitive in China. Communist-ruled Beijing has increasingly imposed its controls over Hong Kong, a former British colony, after taking control of the territory in 1997. 

            China promised that Hong Kong would retain its Western-style freedoms for 50 years after the handover from British rule. But Beijing has been tightening controls after imposing a National Security Law following massive pro-democracy protests in 2019, raising concerns over a weakening of civil liberties such as freedom of speech and the press.

            Under the national security law, those found guilty of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign or external forces could face a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.

            In 2021, Hong Kong implemented a film censorship law would allow authorities to ban films deemed contrary to national security interests. At the time, officials said that regulating films shown online would be outside the scope of the bill.

            Western governments and activists have for years accused China of imprisoning hundreds of thousands of ethnic minorities — mainly Uyghurs — in the western region of Xinjiang in detention camps. China has rejected accusations it uses forced labor in those camps.

            China says the camps are education centers designed to teach Mandarin Chinese and vocational skills. 

            Censorship of Western television series or films is common in mainland China, with censors deleting scenes or banning content seen as going against values deemed appropriate by the Chinese Communist Party.

            The Simpsons has been screened at times in China. According to checks by The AP, clips of the Simpsons can still be found on Chinese video sites, but not the scene from “One Angry Lisa.”HONG KONG (AP) — Walt Disney Co. has removed an episode from cartoon series The Simpsons that included a reference to “forced labor camps” in China from its streaming service in Hong Kong.The company declined to comment on why the episode, “One Angry Lisa” from The Simpsons’ 34th season, was not available to stream on the Disney Plus streaming service in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory, according to checks by The Associated Press.The episode first aired on television in October and it was not clear when the episode was removed from the Hong Kong streaming service.In the episode, Simpsons character Marge Simpson takes a virtual spin class whose instructor is in front of a virtual background of the Great Wall of China and says: “Behold the wonders of China.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803956,Israel steps up Jerusalem home demolitions as violence rises,"JERUSALEM (AP) — Ratib Matar’s family was growing. They needed more space. 

            Before his granddaughters, now 4 and 5, were born, he built three apartments on an eastern slope overlooking Jerusalem’s ancient landscape. The 50-year-old construction contractor moved in with his brother, son, divorced daughter and their young kids — 11 people in all, plus a few geese.

            But Matar was never at ease. At any moment, the Israeli code-enforcement officers could knock on his door and take everything away.











            That moment came on Jan. 29, days after a Palestinian gunman killed seven people in east Jerusalem, the deadliest attack in the contested capital since 2008. Israel’s new far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir called not only for the sealing of the assailant's family home, but also the immediate demolition of dozens of Palestinian homes built without permits in east Jerusalem, among other punitive steps. 

            Mere hours after Ben-Gvir's comments, the first bulldozers rumbled into Matar's neighborhood of Jabal Mukaber.

            For many Palestinians, the gathering pace of home demolitions is part of the new ultranationalist government's broader battle for control of east Jerusalem, captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war and claimed by the Palestinians as the capital of a future independent state. 

            The battle is waged with building permits and demolition orders — and it is one the Palestinians feel they cannot win. Israel says it is simply enforcing building regulations.

            “Our construction is under siege from Israel,” Matar said. His brothers and sons lingered beside the ruins of their home, drinking bitter coffee and receiving visitors as though in mourning. “We try really hard to build, but in vain,"" he said.

            Last month, Israel demolished 39 Palestinian homes, structures and businesses in east Jerusalem, displacing over 50 people, according to the United Nations. That was more than a quarter of the total number of demolitions in 2022. Ben-Gvir posted a photo on Twitter of the bulldozers clawing at Matar's home.

            “We will fight terrorism with all the means at our disposal,” he wrote, though Matar's home had nothing to do with the Palestinian shooting attacks.

            Most Palestinian apartments in east Jerusalem were built without hard-to-get permits. A 2017 study by the U.N. described it as “virtually impossible"" to secure them.

            The Israeli municipality allocates scant land for Palestinian development, the report said, while facilitating the expansion of Israeli settlements. Little Palestinian property was registered before Israel annexed east Jerusalem in 1967, a move not internationally recognized.

            Matar said the city rejected his building permit application twice because his area is not zoned for residential development. He's now trying a third time.

            The penalty for unauthorized building is often demolition. If families don't tear their houses down themselves, the government charges them for the job. Matar is dreading his bill — he knows neighbors who paid over $20,000 to have their houses razed.

            Now homeless, Matar and his family are staying with relatives. He vows to build again on land he inherited from his grandparents, though he has no faith in the Israeli legal system.

            “They don't want a single Palestinian in all of Jerusalem,” Matar said. Uphill, in the heart of his neighborhood, Israeli flags fluttered from dozens of apartments recently built for religious Jews.

            Since 1967, the government has built 58,000 homes for Israelis in the eastern part of the city, and fewer than 600 for Palestinians, said Daniel Seidemann, an Israeli lawyer specializing in the geopolitics of Jerusalem, citing the government’s statistics bureau and his own analysis. In that time, the city’s Palestinian population has soared by 400%.

            “The planning regime is dictated by the calculus of national struggle,” Seidemann said.

            Israel's city plans show state parks encircling the Old City, with some 60% of Jabal Mukaber zoned as green space, off-limits to Palestinian development. At least 20,000 Palestinian homes in east Jerusalem are now slated for demolition, watchdogs say. 

            Matar and his neighbors face an agonizing choice: Build illegally and live under constant threat of demolition, or leave their birthplace for the occupied West Bank, sacrificing Jerusalem residency rights that allow them to work and travel relatively freely throughout Israel.

            While there are no reliable figures for permit approvals, the Israeli municipality set aside just over 7% of its 21,000 housing plans for Palestinian homes in 2019, reported Ir Amim, an anti-settlement advocacy group. Palestinians are nearly 40% of the city's roughly 1 million people.

            “This is the purpose of this policy,” said Aviv Tatarsky, a researcher at Ir Amim. “Palestinians are forced to leave Jerusalem.""

            Arieh King, a Jerusalem deputy mayor and settler leader, acknowledged that demolitions help Israel entrench control over east Jerusalem, home to the city's most important religious sites.

            “It’s part of enforcing sovereignty,"" King said. “I'm happy that at last we have a minister that understands,"" he added, referring to Ben-Gvir. 

            Ben-Gvir is now pushing for the destruction of an apartment tower housing 100 people. Trying to lower tensions, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delayed the eviction that was planned for Tuesday, Israeli media reported.

            King contended it was possible for Palestinians to secure permits and accused them of building without authorization to avoid an expensive bureaucracy.

            When the al-Abasi family in east Jerusalem found a demolition order plastered on their new breeze-block home last month, they contemplated their options. The government had knocked down their last apartment, built on the same lot, eight years ago. This time, Jaafar al-Abasi decided, he would tear it down himself.

            Al-Abasi hired a tractor and invited his relatives and neighbors to join. The destruction took three days, with breaks for hummus and soda. His three sons borrowed pickaxes and jackhammers, angrily hacking away at the walls they had decorated with colored plates just last month.

            “This place is like a ticking time bomb,” said his brother in law, 48-year-old Mustafa Samhouri, who helped them out.

            Protests over the demolitions have roiled east Jerusalem in recent days. Two weekends ago, Samhouri said, the family's 13-year-old cousin opened fire at Jewish settlers in the neighborhood of Silwan just across the valley, wounding two people before being shot and arrested.

            “The pressure just grows more and more,” Samhouri said. “And at last, boom.""

However, as he wanted to pass through immigration just before midnight on Jan. 21, the electronic system rejected his documents, as he had only applied for leave for the period Jan. 22-26.According to New Power Party (NPP) legislators, Wang created a scene at the airport, shouting at National Immigration Agency (NIA) officials and slamming his fist on a desk.The Presidential Office said Wednesday that after investigating the incident, it had concluded the NSC official did not behave in a suitable way, so he has been relieved of a managerial position and reassigned to a research function, the Liberty Times reported.Civil servants have to behave according to the highest standards, so following this quarrel, the NSC will reflect on how to improve its procedures to prevent such an incident from ever occurring again, a presidential spokesperson said.",2023/2/8,1760,Politics
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803980,Undocumented migrants take advantage of Taiwan’s visa overstay forgiveness offer,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A pair of undocumented migrant parents, who were unable to pay fines for overstaying their visas in Taiwan, took advantage of the visa overstay forgiveness program currently offered by the National Immigration Agency (NIA) and are waiting to go home.The female Indonesian migrant worker, identified only by the pseudonym ""Xiaoting,"" gave birth to a young son with her husband, who is also an undocumented migrant worker, CNA reported. The family lived in Changhua County.However, when Xiaoting's husband, the sole breadwinner in the family, went out one day to buy baby formula, he was arrested and sent to a shelter for overstaying his visa. After the incident, Xiaoting struggled financially and had difficulty raising the child by herself.Xiaoting wanted to return to her home country but hesitated because she could not afford the maximum fine of NT$10,000 (US$330) for overstaying her visa, per CNA. Later, she saw online that the NIA was offering the ""Expanded Overstayers Voluntary Departure Program,"" which exempts overstayers from detention, makes them pay only the minimum fine of NT$2,000 for overstaying, and would not prohibit them from reentering the country, if they turn themselves in before June 30.Upon learning about the program, the undocumented migrant mother took her baby to the NIA’s Nantou County Service Center to turn herself in and seek help.After understanding Xiaoting’s situation, staff at the service center immediately contacted a service station to assist in their resettlement. After completing the relevant procedures and documents, the family of three will be able to return to their home country, per CNA.The NIA urged overstayers to grab the opportunity and turn themselves in within the limited-time period before new regulations kick in.The Nantou County Service Center issued a press release Tuesday (Feb. 7), stating that draft amendments to some provisions of the Immigration Act have been sent to the country’s legislature for review. The amendments seek to raise overstay fines from the current NT$2,000-NT$10,000 to NT$30,000-NT$150,000 and increase the period of restriction on overstayers' reentering the country from a maximum of three years to a maximum of 10 years.",2023/2/8,4762,New Immigrants

Global study on “Furniture” provides a comprehensive assessment of the market’s current and future state.The global furniture market was worth USD 683.21 trillion in 2022. It is projected to grow at a compound annual rate of 5.9% between 2023 and 2030. The furniture market is growing rapidly because people realize how important it is for their home to feel comfortable and welcoming. People who buy furniture are investing in their quality life.Request for a sample report here: https://market.biz/report/global-furniture-market-qy/385755/#requestforsampleFurniture is essential for interior design. It not only supports basic daily functions like eating and sleeping, but it also helps with decorating the home. Online platforms make it easier to purchase furniture. FabFurnish and Urban Ladder, three of India’s most popular e-commerce platforms, are available for furniture purchases. Industry growth is also being driven by a growing demand for versatile and multifunctional products that can be easily moved around in tight spaces. There is a growing demand for furniture that can be moved around and saves space. This will drive furniture demand.Product demand is also affected by infrastructural and residential development. Government regulations regarding furniture, particularly those used in hospitals, demand that furniture manufacturers design and produce furniture that is compliant with these regulations. The British Contract Furnishing Association stipulates that wooden furniture used in hospitals must be sealed with high quality clear lacquer. Clear lacquer is not only durable, but also contains antimicrobial agents to prevent the growth and spread of microorganisms. Companies are also able to offer eco-friendly furniture because of the positive attitude of their customers.However, factors like rising prices for materials and labor, increased competition from online retailers, as well as the effects of tariffs on imported furniture will limit growth in the furniture industry.Wooden Furniture

Global study on “Solid State Drive (SSD)” provides a comprehensive assessment of the market’s current and future state.Solid State Drive (SSD), which was valued at USD 30.12 billion in 2022, is expected to grow at a CAGR 15.2% between 2023 and 2030. Solid-state drives (SSD) are nonvolatile storage devices that store persistent data on solid state flash memory. An SSD is a collection of semiconductor memories organized in a disk drive.

SSD offers many benefits, including faster functioning, greater durability, ease of use, quicker data reads and write speeds, reliability, lower power consumption and video-on-demand.Request for a sample report here: https://market.biz/report/global-solid-state-drive-ssd-market-qy/352333/#requestforsampleCloud computing is rapidly becoming a popular method for individuals and businesses to backup and preserve data. The number of cloud platforms has increased, from classic corporate private clouds to new public clouds to personal clouds at home. This means that SSDs are increasingly needed. As a result technological advances in solid-state storage, SSDs with new interfaces like NVMe and PCIe have been created. PCIe SSDs are becoming more popular for cloud computing due to their improved capabilities, such as fast data access and high speed. The new PCIe SSDs offer excellent performance, low latency, and high frequency.Numerous major players manage their cloud infrastructures to meet the growing SSD demand from customers. Google (US), for example, uses permanent solid-state drives (SSD), storage in open beta to users of its compute engine. This storage offers high input/output operations per sec (IOPS) which enables Google Cloud Platform customers access the SSD more quickly when they need it. The solid-state drive market has seen a significant increase in the use of cloud computing over the past few years.Below 120 GB

This is a substance that eliminates surface oxides from metal and aids in the soldering process. The flux core guarantees that the solder is robust and durable when soldered to the metal.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804049,Swiss parliamentarian delegation visits Taiwan's Kinmen,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The Swiss Parliamentary Intergroup Switzerland-Taiwan delegation met with Kinmen Deputy Magistrate Li Wen-liang (李文良) while on a visit to the outlying island on Wednesday (Feb. 8), in order to understand local residents’ views on cross-strait relations.

            Li said that although Kinmen is a small island that is approximately 150 square kilometers, its role in cross-strait relations is sensitive, UDN reported. The basic living needs of Kinmenese are closely related to cross-strait relations, he added.

            For example, a water shortage should be easy to address, but it is a political issue for Kinmen, and governments on both sides of the strait are facing challenges to resolve this issue.

            He said that four years ago, the island began receiving water from the Jin River, in Quanzhou, China, and now 70-80% of Kinmen's water comes from China.











            Li also mentioned that the “mini-three links” had been affected by the suspension of cross-strait flights during the pandemic, which prevented Chinese immigrants and Kinmenese in China from traveling to Taiwan, per UDN. This decision involved political factors, he said.

            However, he pointed out that the three links have largely resumed. The deputy magistrate said Kinmen must seek a balance in cross-strait relations.

            Swiss lawmaker Fabian Molina said that his country is geographically unique within Europe, as it is surrounded by many small countries, which is quite similar to Kinmen’s situation. Molina said he empathizes with the island’s residents and hoped that the Swiss-Taiwan friendship group will have more exchanges with Kinmen in the future.

            The visiting delegation is led by Molina and Nicolas Walder, who are co-chairs of the Parliamentary Intergroup Switzerland-Taiwan, and includes lawmakers Yves Nidegger, Mustafa Atici, and Leonore Porchet, according to a MOFA press release.

            The trip is “a sign of support for Taiwan,” Molina told NZZ Magazin last month. It will focus on economic cooperation, democracy, and defense, and delve into issues such as “what could happen in the event of a Chinese attack on Taiwan,” he said.

            The lawmakers met with President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文), Legislative Speaker You Si-kun (游絲坤), Control Yuan President Chen Ju (陳菊), Minister of Foreign Affairs Joseph Wu (吳釗燮). They arrived in Taiwan on Feb. 5 and will depart on Thursday (Feb. 9).TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The Swiss Parliamentary Intergroup Switzerland-Taiwan delegation met with Kinmen Deputy Magistrate Li Wen-liang (李文良) while on a visit to the outlying island on Wednesday (Feb. 8), in order to understand local residents’ views on cross-strait relations.Li said that although Kinmen is a small island that is approximately 150 square kilometers, its role in cross-strait relations is sensitive, UDN reported.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804061,"Zelenskyy seeks weaponry in surprise trips to London, Paris","PARIS (AP) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy sought Western support for his country in surprise visits to Britain and France on Wednesday, pushing for fighter jets to battle Russian invaders in a dramatic speech to the U.K. Parliament, and then flying to Paris to meet the French and German leaders over dinner at the Elysee Palace.

            On Thursday, Zelenskyy will join EU leaders at a summit in Brussels, which German Chancellor Olaf Scholz described as a “signal of European solidarity and community.”

            Zelenskyy's European tour and pleas for more advanced weapons came as Ukraine braces for an expected Russian offensive and hatches its own plans to retake land held by Moscow's forces. Western support has been key to Kyiv's surprisingly stiff defense, and the two sides are engaged in grinding battles.











            Zelenskyy thanked the British people for their support since “Day One” of Moscow’s invasion nearly a year ago, as Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said fighter jets were “part of the conversation” about aid to Ukraine.

            “Nothing is off the table,” he said at an evening news conference at a British army base. ""We must arm Ukraine in the short term, but we must bolster Ukraine for the long term.”

            Zelenskyy said Ukraine needs all kinds of supplies, not just planes, but also ammunition and long-range missiles

            “Without this, there would be stagnation which will not bring to anything good,” he said, calling his visit to Britain “very fruitful.”

            Then it was off to Paris for dinner with French President Emmanuel Macron and Scholz, the German chancellor. 

            Zelenskyy was greeted Wednesday night on the steps of the Elysee Palace with a friendly embrace by Macron, and then all three leaders headed inside. The visit marks a turnaround in Zelenskyy’s relations toward France and Germany, which earlier in the war were viewed by many in Ukraine as not doing enough to help.

            “Ukraine can count on France, its European partners and allies to win the war. Russia cannot and must not win,” Macron said before their working dinner. Macron’s office put out a statement confirming that Zelenskyy would attend Thursday's summit in Brussels, where EU leaders will pledge their support for the Ukrainian people.

            Zelenskyy’s travel to European capitals on Wednesday was just his second foreign trip since Russia invaded on Feb, 24, 2022. In December, he traveled to Washington to meet with President Joe Biden and address the U.S. Congress. 

            His day began when he arrived on a Royal Air Force plane in London and was greeted on the tarmac with an embrace from Sunak. They held talks at the prime minister’s 10 Downing St. residence before Zelenskyy’s speech to lawmakers in the 900-year-old Westminster Hall, the oldest — and, on a cold winter day, unheated — part of Parliament.

            “London has stood with Kyiv since Day One,” he said, repeatedly thanking Britons for their aid. The U.K. has sent Ukraine more than 2 billion pounds ($2.5 billion) in weapons and equipment,

            Wearing his trademark olive drab sweatshirt, he urged allies to deliver jets to Ukraine, saying combat aircraft would be “wings for freedom.”

            In a dramatic gesture, Zelenskyy presented the speaker of the House of Commons with a Ukrainian air force helmet, inscribed by a Ukrainian pilot: “We have freedom. Give us wings to protect it.”

            The president was trying to soften allies’ reluctance to send advanced fighter jets, both because they are complex to fly and for fear of escalating the war.

            The U.K. has repeatedly said it’s not practical to provide Ukraine with British warplanes. But in a shift, the government said Wednesday it was “actively looking” at whether Ukraine could be sent Western jets, and was “in discussion with our allies” about it.

            Britain also said it would train Ukrainian pilots in Britain on “NATO-standard fighter jets” within weeks.

            Sunak spokesman Max Blain said the government was exploring “what jets we may be able to give” over the coming years, but had not made a decision on whether to send its F-35 or Typhoons.

            “We think it is right to provide both short-term equipment … that can help win the war now, but also look to the medium to long term to make sure Ukraine has every possible capacity it requires,” he said.

            Ukraine has sought Western fighter jets since early in the war to bolster its force of Soviet-made MiG-29 and Su fighters. The success of its air force in defending its skies and territory despite Russia’s bigger numbers helped push back Moscow’s initial assault.

            The Russian Embassy in London strongly warned the U.K. against supplying the warplanes, saying Britain would bear responsibility “for another twist of escalation and the ensuing military-political consequences for the European continent and the entire world.”

            Macron has said France hasn’t ruled out sending fighter jets but set conditions, including not leading to an escalation of tensions or using the aircraft “to touch Russian soil,” and not resulting in weakening “the capacities of the French army.”

            Sunak and Zelenskyy flew by helicopter to Lulworth Camp, a base in southwest England, where they met Ukrainian troops being trained on the Challenger 2 tanks the U.K. is sending as part of the hundreds that Kyiv says it needs. More than 10,000 Ukrainian troops have been trained in the U.K., and Britain says it will train 20,000 more in 2023.

            “I am proud that today we will expand that training from soldiers to marines and fighter jet pilots, ensuring Ukraine has a military able to defend its interests well into the future,” Sunak said. 

            Zelenskyy also went to Buckingham Palace, where he met with King Charles III, who greeted him with a broad smile and a warm handshake before they had tea. The king told the president that “we’ve all been worried about you and thinking about your country for so long.”

            In his Parliament speech, Zelenskyy noted that Charles was a qualified military pilot.

            “The king is an air force pilot,” Zekenskyy said, and “in Ukraine today, every air force pilot is a king.”

            Zelenskyy was greeted with applause, cheers and cries of “Slava Ukraini” — “Glory to Ukraine” — as he arrived in Parliament, where his cause has wide support.

            He had addressed the U.K. Parliament remotel y in March, two weeks after the start of the invasion. He echoed World War II leader Winston Churchill’s famous “never surrender” speech, vowing that Ukrainians “will fight till the end at sea, in the air. We will continue fighting for our land, whatever the cost.”

            On Wednesday, he recalled how on a prewar visit to London, he sat in Churchill's chair in his subterranean wartime headquarters, and had a feeling that only now he understands: “It was the feeling of how bravery takes you through the most unimaginable hardships to finally reward you with victory.""

            In past wars, “evil lost,” he told U.K. lawmakers. “We know Russia will lose and we we know victory will change the world.″

            He also urged stronger sanctions against Moscow until “Russia is deprived of any possibility to finance this war.”

            Coinciding with the visit, the U.K. government announced new sanctions against six entities that Britain said supplied equipment to the Russian military. CST, a manufacturer of Russian drones and parts for helicopters used against Ukraine, were among them.

            The London visit came as Russian forces shelled areas of eastern Ukraine in what Kyiv authorities believe is part of a thrust by the Kremlin’s forces before the invasion anniversary. Moscow, meanwhile, believes Ukraine is preparing its own battlefield push.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804062,Sri Lankan leader appeals for patience amid economic crisis,"COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) — Sri Lanka’s president on Wednesday appealed for patience amid the country's worst economic crisis but promised brighter times ahead.

            President Ranil Wickremesinghe said in a policy speech after inaugurating a new parliamentary session that he had been forced to make unpopular decisions to salvage the country's finances, including by implementing measures such as higher taxes.

            “Inflation rises during an economic crisis. The price of goods increases. Employment is at risk. Businesses collapse. Taxes increase. It is difficult for all sections of the society to survive. However, if we endure this hardship for another five to six months, we can reach a solution,” Wickremesinghe said.











            He added that government employees would receive additional pay in the third and fourth quarters of the year and that the private sector would also be granted concessions. Wickremesinghe said that “if we continue in this manner ... the public would become prosperous, with income sources increasing. The interest rate can be reduced. In another three years, present incomes can be increased by 75%.”

            Sri Lanka is effectively bankrupt and has suspended repayment of nearly $7 billion in foreign debt due this year pending the outcome of talks with the International Monetary Fund for a bailout package.

            The country’s foreign debt exceeds $51 billion, of which $28 billion must be repaid by 2027.

            A currency crisis has also led to shortages of essential items like food, fuel, medicine and cooking gas. Massive protests last year forced Wickremesinghe’s predecessor, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, to flee the country and resign.

            Wickremesinghe has managed to somewhat stabilize the economic situation by reducing the shortages, enabling schools and offices to function. But power cuts continue because of the fuel shortage, and the government struggles to find money to pay government employees.

            India was the first bilateral creditor to announce financial assurances to the IMF and on Tuesday the president’s office shared with media a statement from the Paris Club — a group of creditor nations including the U.S., Britain, France and others — giving similar assurances.

            However, the IMF program hinges on China, which owns about 10% of Sri Lanka’s foreign debt and has given a two-year debt moratorium starting from 2022. But a visiting U.S. diplomat said last week that China has not done enough to meet IMF standards for loan restructuring.

            “India has agreed to debt restructuring and has extended financial assurances. On the one hand, the Paris Club and India are continuing discussions. We are in direct discussions with China,” Wickremesinghe said.

            “We are now working towards unifying the approaches of other countries and that of China. I express our gratitude to all the countries that support us in this effort,” he said.

            Also Wednesday, government doctors, university teachers and other workers from ports and the power and petroleum sectors held protests, demanding the government to lower income taxes.

            Employees from the state-run power generation company also staged a demonstration in the capital, Colombo.

            In his speech, Wickremesinghe also reiterated that he will ensure maximum power sharing with ethnic minority Tamils to resolve a long-standing conflict.

            Tamil rebels fought for an independent state in the country’s northeast for more than 25 years until they were crushed by the military in 2009. More than 100,000 people were killed in the conflict by conservative U.N estimates.

            It is critical for Sri Lanka to resolve the ethnic conflict to win the international community's support to rebuild the country's economy. 

            Neighboring India has shown a special interest in resolving the problem due to internal pressure from its own nearly 80 million Tamils who have linguistic, cultural and family ties with the Tamils in Sri Lanka.

            As Wickremesinghe spoke, hundreds of Buddhist monks demonstrated near Parliament against the proposal to share power with the Tamils. The monks said a government plan to give provincial councils power over policing and land would lead to division in the country. 

            Rev. Omalpe Sobitha, a leading Buddhist monk, said the president had no mandate to share powers and would be remembered as a “traitor” if he went ahead with the plan.

            A group of monks also burned parts of the constitution in protest.

But power cuts continue because of the fuel shortage, and the government struggles to find money to pay government employees.India was the first bilateral creditor to announce financial assurances to the IMF and on Tuesday the president’s office shared with media a statement from the Paris Club — a group of creditor nations including the U.S., Britain, France and others — giving similar assurances.However, the IMF program hinges on China, which owns about 10% of Sri Lanka’s foreign debt and has given a two-year debt moratorium starting from 2022. But a visiting U.S. diplomat said last week that China has not done enough to meet IMF standards for loan restructuring.“India has agreed to debt restructuring and has extended financial assurances. On the one hand, the Paris Club and India are continuing discussions. We are in direct discussions with China,” Wickremesinghe said.“We are now working towards unifying the approaches of other countries and that of China. I express our gratitude to all the countries that support us in this effort,” he said.Also Wednesday, government doctors, university teachers and other workers from ports and the power and petroleum sectors held protests, demanding the government to lower income taxes.Employees from the state-run power generation company also staged a demonstration in the capital, Colombo.In his speech, Wickremesinghe also reiterated that he will ensure maximum power sharing with ethnic minority Tamils to resolve a long-standing conflict.Tamil rebels fought for an independent state in the country’s northeast for more than 25 years until they were crushed by the military in 2009. More than 100,000 people were killed in the conflict by conservative U.N estimates.It is critical for Sri Lanka to resolve the ethnic conflict to win the international community's support to rebuild the country's economy.Neighboring India has shown a special interest in resolving the problem due to internal pressure from its own nearly 80 million Tamils who have linguistic, cultural and family ties with the Tamils in Sri Lanka.As Wickremesinghe spoke, hundreds of Buddhist monks demonstrated near Parliament against the proposal to share power with the Tamils. The monks said a government plan to give provincial councils power over policing and land would lead to division in the country.Rev. Omalpe Sobitha, a leading Buddhist monk, said the president had no mandate to share powers and would be remembered as a “traitor” if he went ahead with the plan.A group of monks also burned parts of the constitution in protest.___Associated Press writer Bharatha Mallawarachi contributed to this report",2023/2/8,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804063,Domenico Tedesco appointed as Belgium's new head coach,"BRUSSELS (AP) — Domenico Tedesco has been appointed head coach of Belgium's national team with a mission to rebuild in the aftermath of the Red Devils' World Cup disappointment.

            The Belgian federation said Wednesday that the 37-year-old German-Italian, who previously coached Schalke, Spartak Moscow and Leipzig, has signed a deal until after the European Championship next year in Germany. 

            “For me it is a great honor to be the new head coach of Belgium,"" Tedesco said. “I’m really looking forward to the task and I’m extremely motivated. I had a very good feeling right from the first conversation.” 











            Tedesco replaces Roberto Martinez, who led Belgium to a third-place finish at the 2018 World Cup and was in charge of the team for six years. Martinez stepped down after the Red Devils failed to progress to the knockout stage of the 2022 tournament in Qatar.

            The team was ranked No. 1 by FIFA for four years during Martinez’s tenure but never won a major tournament.

            Martinez’s exit coincided with the likely breakup of Belgium’s so-called “Golden Generation,” an era featuring standout attacking players such as Kevin De Bruyne, Eden Hazard, Romelu Lukaku and Dries Mertens.

            The Belgian federation praised Tedesco's ‘’top-level international experience"" as well as his “offensive style of football with plenty of forward pressure."" ​ ​ 

            “His mission is to qualify the Belgian Red Devils for the 2024 European Championship in Germany,"" the federation said.

            Belgium starts its qualifying campaign on March 24 against Sweden. 

            Also, the Belgian federation appointed former international player Frank Vercauteren — who served as interim coach a few years ago — as its new sports director. 

            “Belgium has also been fortunate to be able to count on a large pool of talent for several years, but we must never rest on our laurels,"" Vercauteren said. “It is our duty to prepare the future. It is not enough to be strong on paper; the most important thing is to convert our qualities into results on the pitch, and this with all our national teams. This must be our ambition.” ​

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804086,American coach Pellegrino Matarazzo hired by Hoffenheim,"SINSHEIM, Germany (AP) — American coach Pellegrino Matarazzo was hired by Bundesliga club Hoffenheim on Wednesday, four months after he was fired by relegation rival Stuttgart.

            The New Jersey-born Matarazzo spent just over two years at Hoffenheim as an assistant coach and youth coach from 2017 through 2019 before taking the Stuttgart job. 

            “Rino doesn't just know our club, but also a large part of the team from his own experience. Likewise, we know him too and so we're convinced that he's the right man for the head coach position,” Hoffenheim sporting director Alexander Rosen said. “He didn't just lead VfB Stuttgart to promotion, but also proved his qualities in the fight to stay in the Bundesliga. He can handle pressure and knows what's needed in this situation.”











            Matarazzo led Stuttgart to promotion back to the Bundesliga and kept the team in the top division for two seasons before being fired in October after a winless start to the season.

            Hoffenheim fired André Breitenreiter on Monday after going nine league games without a win and slipping to 14th in the 18-team league. Stuttgart is 16th.

            Matarazzo's first game in charge will be against Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804087,US forces returning to Philippines to counter China threats,"SUBIC BAY, Philippines (AP) — Once-secret ammunition bunkers and barracks lay abandoned, empty and overrun by weeds — vestiges of American firepower in what used to be the United States' largest overseas naval base at Subic Bay in the northern Philippines.

            But that may change in the near future.

            The U.S. has been taking steps to rebuild its military might in the Philippines more than 30 years after the closure of its large bases in the country and reinforcing an arc of military alliances in Asia in a starkly different post-Cold War era when the perceived new regional threat is an increasingly belligerent China.











            On Feb. 2, the longtime allies announced that rotating batches of American forces would be granted access to four more Philippine military camps aside from five other local bases, where U.S.-funded constructions have picked up pace to build barracks, warehouses and other buildings to accommodate a yet-unspecified but expectedly considerable number of visiting troops under a 2014 defense pact. 

            Manila-based political scientist Andrea Chloe Wong said the location of the Philippine camps would give the U.S. military the presence it would need to be a “strong deterrent against Chinese aggression” in the South China Sea, where China, the Philippines and four other governments have had increasingly tense territorial rifts — as well as a potential Chinese invasion of Taiwan, which Beijing views as its own territory to be brought under Chinese control, by force if necessary.

            Around the former U.S. Navy base in Subic, now a bustling commercial freeport and tourism destination northwest of Manila, news of the Philippine government’s decision to allow an expanded American military presence rekindled memories of an era when thousands of U.S. sailors pumped money, life and hope into the neighboring city of Olongapo.

            “Olongapo was like Las Vegas then,"" Filipino businessman AJ Saliba told The Associated Press in an interview in his foreign currency exchange and music shop along what used to be Olongapo’s garish red-light strip.

            “Noisy as early as noon with neon lights turned on and the Americans roaming around. Women were everywhere. Jeepney drivers, tricycles, restaurants, bars, hotels — everybody was making money — so if they will return, my God, you know, that’ll be the best news,” he said.

            U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said during his visit in Manila last week that Washington was not trying to reestablish permanent bases, but that the agreement to broaden its military presence under the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement was “a big deal.”

            Visiting American military personnel could engage the Philippine military in larger joint combat-readiness trainings, provide help in responding rapidly to disasters and press efforts to help modernize Manila’s armed forces, Austin and his Philippine counterpart Carlito Galvez Jr. said.

            “This is part of our effort to modernize our alliance, and these efforts are especially important as the People’s Republic of China continues to advance its illegitimate claims in the West Philippine Sea,"" Austin said at a news conference in Manila.

            Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said the U.S. military’s strengthening in the region was escalating tensions and risking peace and stability. 

            “Regional countries need to remain vigilant and avoid being coerced or used by the U.S.,” Mao told reporters Feb. 2 at a briefing in Beijing.

            Austin and Galvez did not reveal the four new locations where the Americans would be granted access and allowed to preposition weapons and other equipment. The Philippine defense chief said local officials, where the Americans would stay, had to be consulted.

            In November, then-Armed Forces of the Philippines Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Bartolome Bacarro disclosed that the sites included the strategic Subic Bay, where the Navy base was once a boon to the local economy. But two senior Philippine officials told the AP that Subic, where a Philippine navy camp is located, was not among the current list of sites where Washington has sought access for its forces, although they suggested that could change as talks were continuing. The two officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the issue publicly.

            Subic freeport administrator Rolen Paulino said he has not been notified by the government that the former American naval base has been designated as a potential site for visiting U.S. forces. 

            A renewed U.S. military presence at Subic, however, would generate more jobs and raise additional freeport revenues at a crucial time when many Filipinos and businesses are still struggling to recover from two years of COVID-19 lockdowns and an economic recession wrought by coronavirus outbreaks, Paulino said.

            “I see them as tourists,” he said of the U.S. forces whose presence could boost economic recovery.

            About the size of Singapore, the former American Navy base at Subic with its deep harbors, a ship repair yard and huge warehouses had been used to support the U.S. war effort in Vietnam in the 1960s and ′70s. It was shut down and transformed into a commercial freeport and recreational complex in 1992 after the Philippine Senate rejected an extension of U.S. lease.

            A year earlier, the U.S. Air Force withdrew from Clark Air Base near Subic after nearby Mount Pinatubo roared back to life in the second-largest volcanic eruption of the 20th century and belched ash on the air base and outlying regions. 

            The American flag was lowered for the final time and the last batch of American sailors left Subic in November 1992, ending nearly a century of American military presence in the Philippines that began in 1898 when the U.S. seized the archipelago in a new colonial era after Spain held the Southeast Asian nation as a colony for more than three centuries. Washington granted independence on July 4, 1946, but maintained military bases and facilities, including Subic.

            China’s seizure in the mid-1990s of Mischief Reef, a coral outcrop within the exclusive economic zone of the Philippines that extends into the South China Sea, “provided the first hint that the allies may have been too quick to downgrade their relationship,"" said Greg Poling, director of the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative at the Washington, D.C.-based Center for Strategic and International Studies.

            The Philippine Constitution prohibits permanent basing of foreign troops in the country and their involvement in local combat but allows temporary visits by foreign troops under security pacts such as the 2014 Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement and a 1998 Visiting Forces Agreement. 

            The 1998 agreement allowed a large number of American forces to be deployed in the southern Philippines to help provide combat training and intelligence to Filipino forces battling the then-al Qaida-linked Abu Sayyaf group, which was blamed for deadly bombings and mass kidnappings for ransom, including three Americans — one of whom was beheaded and another shot and killed in a Philippine army rescue. The third survived.

            There is still, however, domestic opposition to a U.S. presence in the Philippines, which left-wing groups have criticized as neo-colonialism, reinforced by the 2014 killing of a Filipina transgender woman by a U.S. Marine, Wong said.

            Governor Manuel Mamba of northern Cagayan province, where Bacarro said the U.S. has reportedly sought access for its forces in two local military encampments, vowed to oppose such an American military presence. Cagayan, located on the northern tip of the main Luzon island, lies across a narrow sea border from Taiwan, the Taiwan Strait and southern China.

            “It’ll be very dangerous for us. If they stay here, whoever is their enemy will become our enemy,” Mamba told the AP by telephone, adding the Philippines could be targeted by nuclear weapons if the conflict over Taiwan boils over.

            “You cannot really remove any presumption by anyone that the Philippines has a nuclear capability through the Americans, who will be here,” Mamba said.

In recent years, this tradition has evolved into the stacking of bags of rice which, with the assistance of clear packing tape, can transform this mountain of rice into a giant turtle, complete with an upright head and legs.Villagers believe that praying for turtles brings them luck and safety, per the CNA report.The rice turtle pictured here is one of the largest in Penghu, belonging to the Guanyin Temple located in Huxi Township, Longmen Village. It is comprised of 31,000 Taiwan catties (18,600 kg) of rice.According to custom, whoever needs an extra bit of food over the winter can take some home, with the caveat that they are expected to return the favor by providing even more rice next year for the giant turtle, ensuring the tradition continues.",2023/2/8,750,Photo of the Day

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804107,Super Bowl has rare matchup of top 2 regular-season teams,"This year's Super Bowl features a rare matchup of the NFL’s top two teams from the regular season.

            The Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs were the league's only 14-game winners, marking just the sixth time since the 1970 merger that the squads with sole possession of the two best records in the regular season met for the championship.

            The last time it happened came after the 2013 season when Seattle beat Denver 43-8 in a matchup of 13-win teams.











            That blowout was relatively typical of these meetings, with the average margin of victory in the previous five powerhouse matchups being 21 points.

            The closest game was Washington’s 37-24 win over Buffalo following the 1991 season. The three others featured San Francisco beating Miami 38-16 after the 1984 season, Dallas topping Denver 27-10 to cap the 1977 season and Oakland beating Minnesota 32-14 the previous year.

            Since seeding began in 1975, this is the 15th time the top team in each conference made it to the Super Bowl. The previous time came after the 2017 season when the Eagles won their first Super Bowl championship by beating New England 41-33.

            This is also the third time both Super Bowl teams won at least 14 games in the regular season, although both Kansas City and Philadelphia needed wins in the added 17th game to get there. Atlanta and Denver did it in 16-game seasons in 1998, and Miami and San Francisco in 1984.

            The Chiefs and Eagles also have been in control all postseason, with neither team trailing in the playoffs. The only other times both Super Bowl teams did that came in the 2004 season (Patriots vs. Eagles), 1991 season (Bills vs. Washington) and 1966 season (Packers vs. Chiefs).

            AIR IT OUT

            Patrick Mahomes will try to do something that has never been done before in the NFL by following up a regular season when he led the league in yards passing with a Super Bowl title.

            Mahomes threw for 5,250 yards during the regular season — 511 more than second-place Justin Herbert for the largest gap between first and second place since Kurt Warner beat out Peyton Manning by 699 yards in 2001.

            The only player to reach the Super Bowl after throwing for more yards in the regular season than Mahomes was Manning, with a record 5,477 in 2013. His Broncos lost 43-8 to Seattle in the Super Bowl.

            That was one of six times before Mahomes that the player who led the league in yards passing made it to the Super Bowl, with all of them losing. The others were Tom Brady (2017 season), Brady (2007), Rich Gannon (2002), Warner (2001) and Dan Marino (1984).

            COACHING REUNION

            
                Chiefs coach Andy Reid joins Dan Reeves as the only coaches to face a franchise in the Super Bowl that they previously took to the big game.

            Reid coached the Eagles to their second Super Bowl following the 2004 season before getting fired after the 2012 season. He quickly built Kansas City into a power and now is ready for his fourth Super Bowl appearance as a head coach — the ninth coach to reach that mark.

            Reid will hope for better luck in his rematch than Reeves had after the 1998 season against a Denver organization he had guided to the Super Bowl in the 1986, ‘87 and ’89 seasons before losing all three. The Broncos beat Reeves and the Atlanta Falcons 34-19 in the Super Bowl.

            Two other coaches faced their former teams in the Super Bowl and ended up on the winning side: Jon Gruden led Tampa Bay past the Raiders after the 2002 season and Weeb Ewbank coached the Jets to a huge upset over the Colts following the 1968 season.

            The Eagles will be the sixth franchise to reach the Super Bowl under four coaches, with Nick Sirianni joining Doug Pederson, Reid and Dick Vermeil.

            The Raiders, 49ers, Colts and Rams all got there with four coaches, and the Broncos did it with a record five. 

            TERRIFIC TIGHT END

            Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce has put together a playoff career topped perhaps only by the greatest receiver ever in Jerry Rice.

            Kelce has 127 catches in 17 career playoff games for 1,467 yards and 15 touchdowns. The only player to top any of those numbers was Rice, with 151 catches for 2,245 yards and 22 TDs in 29 playoff games. 

            The Mahomes-Kelce connection also is one of the best, with their 13 TD passes in the playoffs trailing only the 15 Tom Brady threw to Rob Gronkowski.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804108,China says it was smeared in Biden State of the Union speech,"BEIJING (AP) — China says it was smeared in U.S. President Joe Biden’s State of the Union address that repeatedly mentioned competition between the two countries.

            China does not fear competing with the U.S. but is “opposed to defining the entire China-U.S. relationship in terms of competition,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a daily briefing Wednesday.

            “It is not the practice of a responsible country to smear a country or restrict the country’s legitimate development rights under the excuse of competition, even at the expense of disrupting the global industrial and supply chain,"" Mao said. 











            China will defend its interests and the U.S. should work with it to “promote the return of bilateral relations to a track of sound and stable development,"" she said.

            Mao's comments came against a background of raging disputes over trade, Taiwan, human rights and access to advanced technologies.

            Biden mentioned China and its leader, Xi Jinping, at least seven times in his address Tuesday night, focusing mainly on how the U.S. was increasingly prepared to compete with Beijing while also seeking to avoid conflict. 

            “I’ve made clear with President Xi that we seek competition, not conflict,"" Biden said. 

            “I will make no apologies that we are investing to make America strong. Investing in American innovation, in industries that will define the future, and that China’s government is intent on dominating,"" he said. 

            Biden said his administration is “committed to work with China where it can advance American interests and benefit the world."" 

            However, he also warned that “if China threatens our sovereignty, we will act to protect our country,"" a pointed reference to the shooting down on Saturday of a suspected Chinese spy balloon that had traversed the continental United States.

            China says the balloon was an unmanned civilian airship used for meteorological research and has strongly protested the U.S. action while threatening unspecified countermeasures.

            The incident prompted U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken to cancel a trip to China this week that had stirred hopes of reversing the continued deterioration of relations between Beijing and Washington.BEIJING (AP) — China says it was smeared in U.S. President Joe Biden’s State of the Union address that repeatedly mentioned competition between the two countries.China does not fear competing with the U.S. but is “opposed to defining the entire China-U.S. relationship in terms of competition,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a daily briefing Wednesday.“It is not the practice of a responsible country to smear a country or restrict the country’s legitimate development rights under the excuse of competition, even at the expense of disrupting the global industrial and supply chain,"" Mao said.China will defend its interests and the U.S. should work with it to “promote the return of bilateral relations to a track of sound and stable development,"" she said.Mao's comments came against a background of raging disputes over trade, Taiwan, human rights and access to advanced technologies.Biden mentioned China and its leader, Xi Jinping, at least seven times in his address Tuesday night, focusing mainly on how the U.S. was increasingly prepared to compete with Beijing while also seeking to avoid conflict.“I’ve made clear with President Xi that we seek competition, not conflict,"" Biden said.“I will make no apologies that we are investing to make America strong.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804110,South Korean minister impeached over Itaewon crowd crush,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s opposition-controlled parliament on Wednesday voted to impeach Interior and Safety Minister Lee Sang-min holding him responsible for government failures in disaster planning and the response that likely contributed to the high death toll in a crowd crush that killed nearly 160 people in October.

            The impeachment suspends Lee from his duties and the Constitutional Court has 180 days to rule on whether to unseat him for good or give him back the job.

            Vice Minister Han Chang-seob will be acting minister until the Constitutional Court decides on Lee’s fate.











            Lee is seen as a key ally of conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol, whose office issued an irritated response to his impeachment, accusing opposition lawmakers of abandoning legislative principles and creating “shameful history.”

            Lee expressed regret after lawmakers voted 179-109 to impeach him, and he said he would defend his case in the Constitutional Court.

            “(I) hope that the vacuum in public safety (management) created by this unprecedented situation would be minimized,” Lee said in his statement.

            Lee is the first Cabinet minister impeached by the National Assembly, which previously impeached conservative President Park Geun-hye in 2016. The Constitutional Court removed her from office and she was imprisoned for corruption before her liberal successor pardoned her in December 2021.

            Lee’s impeachment highlights the growing impasse Yoon faces in a parliament controlled by his liberal opponents and could further intensify the country’s partisan political fighting that has fueled a national divide. 

            Lee’s impeachment came weeks after police announced they are seeking criminal charges, including involuntary manslaughter and negligence, against 23 officials, about half of them law enforcement officers, for a lack of safety measures they said were responsible for the crowd crush in Itaewon, a major nightlife district in Seoul.

            Following a 74-day inquiry into the incident, a special investigation team led by the National Police Agency concluded that police and public officials in Seoul’s Yongsan district failed to employ meaningful crowd control measures despite anticipating huge gatherings of Halloween revelers. They also ignored pedestrian calls placed to police hotlines that warned of a swelling crowd hours before the surge turned deadly on Oct. 28.

            Officials also botched their response once people began getting toppled over and crushed in a narrow alley clogged with partygoers near Hamilton Hotel around 10 p.m., failing to establish effective control of the scene and allow rescue workers to reach the injured in time.

            However, opposition politicians claimed that police investigators went soft on higher members of Yoon’s government, including Lee and National Police Agency Commissioner General Yoon Hee-keun, who were facing calls to resign. 

            The police investigators said they had closed their probes on Lee’s ministry and the National Police Agency before handing over the case to prosecutors, saying it was difficult to establish the direct responsibility of those offices.

            Oh Yeong-hwan, lawmaker and spokesperson for the main opposition Democratic Party, said lawmakers “carried out the order of the people” in impeaching Lee, who he said should be held responsible for the deadly crowd surge in Itaewon. He criticized Yoon for sticking with Lee in the face of mounting calls for his removal.

            “The National Assembly had to hold (Lee) to account, because President Yoon Suk Yeol refused to accept that responsibility,” Oh said.

            Lawmaker Jang Dong-hyuk of Yoon’s People’s Power Party accused the opposition of “tramping on (South Korea’s) constitutional order,” insisting that Lee was impeached without a justifiable cause.

            He insisted that the liberals were motivated by political vendetta against Yoon as prosecutors under his government push forward an investigation into corruption allegations surrounding Democratic Party Chairman Lee Jae-myung, a firebrand lawmaker who narrowly lost to Yoon in last year’s presidential elections.

            Lee Sang-min faced huge criticism shortly after the crowd crush after he insisted that having more police and emergency personnel on the ground still wouldn’t have prevented the tragedy in Itaewon, in what was seen as an attempt to sidestep questions about the lack of preventive measures.

            Despite anticipating a crowd of more than 100,000, Seoul police had assigned 137 officers to Itaewon on the day of the crush. Those officers were focused on monitoring narcotics use and violent crimes, which experts say left few resources for pedestrian safety.

            Some experts have called the crush in Itaewon a “manmade disaster” that could have been prevented with fairly simple steps, such as employing more police and public workers to monitor bottleneck points, enforcing one-way walk lanes and blocking narrow pathways or temporarily closing Itaewon’s subway station to prevent large numbers of people moving in the same direction.SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s opposition-controlled parliament on Wednesday voted to impeach Interior and Safety Minister Lee Sang-min holding him responsible for government failures in disaster planning and the response that likely contributed to the high death toll in a crowd crush that killed nearly 160 people in October.The impeachment suspends Lee from his duties and the Constitutional Court has 180 days to rule on whether to unseat him for good or give him back the job.Vice Minister Han Chang-seob will be acting minister until the Constitutional Court decides on Lee’s fate.Lee is seen as a key ally of conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol, whose office issued an irritated response to his impeachment, accusing opposition lawmakers of abandoning legislative principles and creating “shameful history.”Lee expressed regret after lawmakers voted 179-109 to impeach him, and he said he would defend his case in the Constitutional Court.“(I) hope that the vacuum in public safety (management) created by this unprecedented situation would be minimized,” Lee said in his statement.Lee is the first Cabinet minister impeached by the National Assembly, which previously impeached conservative President Park Geun-hye in 2016.

They also ignored pedestrian calls placed to police hotlines that warned of a swelling crowd hours before the surge turned deadly on Oct. 28.Officials also botched their response once people began getting toppled over and crushed in a narrow alley clogged with partygoers near Hamilton Hotel around 10 p.m., failing to establish effective control of the scene and allow rescue workers to reach the injured in time.However, opposition politicians claimed that police investigators went soft on higher members of Yoon’s government, including Lee and National Police Agency Commissioner General Yoon Hee-keun, who were facing calls to resign.The police investigators said they had closed their probes on Lee’s ministry and the National Police Agency before handing over the case to prosecutors, saying it was difficult to establish the direct responsibility of those offices.Oh Yeong-hwan, lawmaker and spokesperson for the main opposition Democratic Party, said lawmakers “carried out the order of the people” in impeaching Lee, who he said should be held responsible for the deadly crowd surge in Itaewon. He criticized Yoon for sticking with Lee in the face of mounting calls for his removal.“The National Assembly had to hold (Lee) to account, because President Yoon Suk Yeol refused to accept that responsibility,” Oh said.Lawmaker Jang Dong-hyuk of Yoon’s People’s Power Party accused the opposition of “tramping on (South Korea’s) constitutional order,” insisting that Lee was impeached without a justifiable cause.He insisted that the liberals were motivated by political vendetta against Yoon as prosecutors under his government push forward an investigation into corruption allegations surrounding Democratic Party Chairman Lee Jae-myung, a firebrand lawmaker who narrowly lost to Yoon in last year’s presidential elections.Lee Sang-min faced huge criticism shortly after the crowd crush after he insisted that having more police and emergency personnel on the ground still wouldn’t have prevented the tragedy in Itaewon, in what was seen as an attempt to sidestep questions about the lack of preventive measures.Despite anticipating a crowd of more than 100,000, Seoul police had assigned 137 officers to Itaewon on the day of the crush. Those officers were focused on monitoring narcotics use and violent crimes, which experts say left few resources for pedestrian safety.Some experts have called the crush in Itaewon a “manmade disaster” that could have been prevented with fairly simple steps, such as employing more police and public workers to monitor bottleneck points, enforcing one-way walk lanes and blocking narrow pathways or temporarily closing Itaewon’s subway station to prevent large numbers of people moving in the same direction.",2023/2/9,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804112,"Pitch in spotlight as India, Australia renew test rivalry","NAGPUR, India (AP) — With qualification for the World Test Championship final at stake, there’s extra scrutiny around all facets of the series when India and Australia renew their rivalry for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.

            The pitch being prepared for the first test starting Thursday at Nagpur has already gained much of the spotlight.

            Australian media highlighted concerns after ground staff watered and rolled only certain areas of the match wicket on Tuesday evening, leaving other parts drier — perceived Down Under as a disadvantage for left-handed batters. Australia has more left-handers in the order than India.











            While this is a signature method to preparing turning wickets in the Indian sub-continent, the visuals were enough to cause apprehension for the touring party. 

            “We know it's tough to tour here, but it is also exciting,"" Australia captain pat Cummins said. “We will have to deal with the challenge,” of turning wickets. Cummins added that off-spinner would be crucial to Australia's efforts in the four-test series.

            The other test matches will be played in Delhi, Dharamsala and Ahmedabad.

            The subject of turning tracks has dominated the build-up to this much-anticipated contest, with former Australia wicketkeeper Ian Healy among those who asked for “fair wickets.”

            “I think if they produce fair Indian wickets, that are good batting wickets, to start with, (that) probably spin and spin pretty consistently but spin a long way, late in the match, we (Australia) win,” Healy said in a radio interview.

            Meanwhile, former India cricketer and coach Ravi Shastri called for the pitch to turn from ball one. “If you are fielding first, you would want to see the ball turning a bit,"" he said. “It’s your strength, capitalize on it.”

            The pitch debate was also raised when Australia last toured India in 2017. The hosts had won that hotly-contested series 2-1.

            In between, India toured Australia in 2018-19 and again in 2020-21, winning both series 2-1. 

            The Australians haven't won the trophy since 2014-15 at home, and haven't won in India since 2004-05. 

            The visitors will be missing experienced pace bowlers Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood and allrounder Cameron Green because of injuries.

            That likely means Scott Boland will get his first overseas test cap as a pace partner for Cummins, with either left-armer Ashton Agar or uncapped 22-year-old Todd Murphy to partner partner Lyon in the spin department.

            India will be without batter Shreyas Iyer because of injury and also faces a selection dilemma regarding in-form Shubman Gill, and whether vice-captain Lokesh Rahul should make way owing to his form.

            There is also the option of including Suryakumar Yadav, who is the No. 1-ranked T20 batsman. 

            “Gill has been in supreme form and scored a lot of big runs. Yadav has also shown us his scoring range,"" India skipper Rohit Sharma said. “We have not made this decision yet.”

            The hosts could play both batsmen, and line up with three spinners and one pace bowler, depending on the final nature of the Nagpur pitch. The toss-up for the final spin slot will be between left-arm spinner Axar Patel and wrist spinner Kuldeep Yadav. 

            All-rounder Ravindra Jadeja is fit again and will resume his spin partnership with off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin. 

            The four-test series will also decide the finalists for the World Test Championship final to be played at the Oval in London from June 7.

            Australia is in pole position to take one of the two final spots, leading the championship standings with a 75.56 win percentage. 

            Only a 4-0 loss in this series, coupled with Sri Lanka and South Africa winning their upcoming contests against New Zealand and West Indies, will see Australia ousted. 

            India also will watch the other contests keenly. Its fortunes are dependent more on the outcome of Sri Lanka’s tour of New Zealand. 

            A single loss for the Sri Lankans would mean a 2-2 draw in the four tests against Australia would suffice for India’s qualification. It would need a minimum 3-1 victory over Australia in case both Sri Lanka and South Africa win their series by a 2-0 margin. 

            India is in ranked second in the nine-team championship with a 58.93 win percentage, followed by Sri Lanka with 53.33 and South Africa with 48.72.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804189,Stella Jean quits Milan Fashion Week over lack of inclusion,"MILAN (AP) — The only Black designer belonging to Italy’s fashion chamber withdrew Wednesday from this month’s Milan Fashion Week, alleging a lack of support for diversity and inclusion after the chamber “abandoned” a project to promote young designers of color working in Italy.

            Stella Jean interrupted a press conference by the Italian National Fashion Chamber to announce that neither she nor five members of the We Are Made in Italy collective of designers of color would participate in fashion week.

            She also said she had started a hunger strike Wednesday out of concern members of WAMI, an initiative launched in 2020 on the heels of the Black Lives Matter movement, could suffer a professional backlash for her activism.











            The moves signaled a dramatic denouement of a nearly three-year-collaboration with the chamber to promote designers of color.

            “The chamber told us, ‘We didn’t know there were Italian designers who weren’t white.’ We brought them to the runway. They supported us for two years. Then we were abandoned,’’ Jean told the press conference.

            Italian Fashion Chamber President Carlo Capasa assured her from the dais that the chamber had no intention of retaliating in any way. He expressed regret that neither she nor the WAMI members would participate in Fashion Week.

            “Stella’s contribution has always been appreciated. We Italians need to have our conscience stimulated,’’ he said. “As for WAMI, we are not people who retaliate. For us it is important to promote new brands.”

            He noted that two WAMI designers from previous seasons were presenting collections during Milan Fashion Week, which runs from Feb. 21-27.

            In addition, the chamber has included on the fashion week calendar the inaugural edition of the Black Carpet Awards recognizing the achievements of minorities in Italian society, and was hosting another diversity initiative by the owner and editor of U.S.-based Blanc Magazine, Teneshia Carr.

            Jean charged that the chamber had significantly cut back support for WAMI after she made an impassioned speech about the personal price she had paid for highlighting racial injustice in Italy during a runway show last September.

            She also said it backtracked on a promise to create a Black board within the chamber to promote diversity and inclusion. Capasa told AP that he decided against the board after WAMI made social media posts that cast a negative light on some Italian fashion brands.

            “We wrote a nice letter, saying we want to give them the liberty to express themselves,’’ Capasa said, adding that the chamber could not host any board that appeared to take public swipes at other members.

            Italian-Haitian Jean, who made her Milan runway premiere in 2013 on the Armani runway, said she and her family have been subjected to retaliation for her activism for racial justice in Italy. She said that included death threats against her daughter by other minors, and the termination of professional relationships for her.

            “When you speak of retaliations, of death threats, people, I work in fashion. I don’t traffic arms, I don’t traffic drugs or make money from trafficking women,’’ Jean said. “It is absurd, vile, shameful and inhuman that I must speak for people who feel their lives are in danger, who feel they will suffer the same retaliation.”

            WAMI was launched by Jean, African-American designer Edward Buchanan and the head of Afro Fashion Week Milano, Michelle Ngonmo, to draw attention to the lack of minority representation in the Italian fashion world. It followed some racial gaffes by major fashion houses that made global headlines. 

            Ngonmo told the AP that financial support for the project from the chamber had dwindled over the three years it has run so far, and that Afro Fashion Week Milano wasn’t able to come up with 20,000 euros ($21,000) to support the five young designers in making solid looks to present, plus a video.

            The Italian fashion chamber fully supported the collections for the two WAMI classes, each with five designers, but hasn't funded the third generation, Ngonmo and Jean said. 

            A September show featuring Jean, Buchanan and WAMI was financed through other allies and their own contributions. The latest WAMI collections were to be presented by video on Feb. 22.

            “Maybe the message is the whole industry needs to open their eyes and say, ‘What can we do to make that happen?’” Ngonmo told the AP.

            Capasa emphasized that the project by Blanc Magazine’s Carr is receiving the same support he offered WAMI: a slot on the calendar and a physical space in the Fashion Hub where journalists and buyers can view the collections.

            But Jean insists that Italy’s designers of color deserve special promotion by the chamber, whose role is the promotion of Italian fashion.

            Jean said progress in recent seasons — including opening fashion week with WAMI designer Joy Meribe's runway show, and Jean's own return to the runway in September — had turned out to be “performative.”

            “They used WAMI as a free pass of safe conduct for diversity,’’ Jean told the AP. She said she was withdrawing out of fatigue with the “continual fight” for recognition for designers of color in Italy. 

            “I am a fighter by nature, but I cannot be this way all the time,” she said.MILAN (AP) — The only Black designer belonging to Italy’s fashion chamber withdrew Wednesday from this month’s Milan Fashion Week, alleging a lack of support for diversity and inclusion after the chamber “abandoned” a project to promote young designers of color working in Italy.Stella Jean interrupted a press conference by the Italian National Fashion Chamber to announce that neither she nor five members of the We Are Made in Italy collective of designers of color would participate in fashion week.She also said she had started a hunger strike Wednesday out of concern members of WAMI, an initiative launched in 2020 on the heels of the Black Lives Matter movement, could suffer a professional backlash for her activism.The moves signaled a dramatic denouement of a nearly three-year-collaboration with the chamber to promote designers of color.“The chamber told us, ‘We didn’t know there were Italian designers who weren’t white.’ We brought them to the runway. They supported us for two years. Then we were abandoned,’’ Jean told the press conference.Italian Fashion Chamber President Carlo Capasa assured her from the dais that the chamber had no intention of retaliating in any way. He expressed regret that neither she nor the WAMI members would participate in Fashion Week.“Stella’s contribution has always been appreciated. We Italians need to have our conscience stimulated,’’ he said. “As for WAMI, we are not people who retaliate. For us it is important to promote new brands.”He noted that two WAMI designers from previous seasons were presenting collections during Milan Fashion Week, which runs from Feb. 21-27.In addition, the chamber has included on the fashion week calendar the inaugural edition of the Black Carpet Awards recognizing the achievements of minorities in Italian society, and was hosting another diversity initiative by the owner and editor of U.S.-based Blanc Magazine, Teneshia Carr.Jean charged that the chamber had significantly cut back support for WAMI after she made an impassioned speech about the personal price she had paid for highlighting racial injustice in Italy during a runway show last September.She also said it backtracked on a promise to create a Black board within the chamber to promote diversity and inclusion. Capasa told AP that he decided against the board after WAMI made social media posts that cast a negative light on some Italian fashion brands.“We wrote a nice letter, saying we want to give them the liberty to express themselves,’’ Capasa said, adding that the chamber could not host any board that appeared to take public swipes at other members.Italian-Haitian Jean, who made her Milan runway premiere in 2013 on the Armani runway, said she and her family have been subjected to retaliation for her activism for racial justice in Italy. She said that included death threats against her daughter by other minors, and the termination of professional relationships for her.“When you speak of retaliations, of death threats, people, I work in fashion. I don’t traffic arms, I don’t traffic drugs or make money from trafficking women,’’ Jean said. “It is absurd, vile, shameful and inhuman that I must speak for people who feel their lives are in danger, who feel they will suffer the same retaliation.”WAMI was launched by Jean, African-American designer Edward Buchanan and the head of Afro Fashion Week Milano, Michelle Ngonmo, to draw attention to the lack of minority representation in the Italian fashion world. It followed some racial gaffes by major fashion houses that made global headlines.Ngonmo told the AP that financial support for the project from the chamber had dwindled over the three years it has run so far, and that Afro Fashion Week Milano wasn’t able to come up with 20,000 euros ($21,000) to support the five young designers in making solid looks to present, plus a video.The Italian fashion chamber fully supported the collections for the two WAMI classes, each with five designers, but hasn't funded the third generation, Ngonmo and Jean said.A September show featuring Jean, Buchanan and WAMI was financed through other allies and their own contributions.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804190,MH17 inquiry: 'Strong indications' Putin OK'd missile supply,"THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — An international team of investigators said Wednesday it found “strong indications” that Russian President Vladimir Putin approved the supply of heavy anti-aircraft weapons to Ukrainian separatists who shot down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in 2014 with a Russian missile.

            However, members of the Joint Investigation Team said they had insufficient evidence to prosecute Putin or any other suspects and they suspended their 8½-year inquiry into the shooting down that killed all 298 people on board the Boeing 777 flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur.

            Russia has always denied any involvement in the downing of the flight over eastern Ukraine on July 17, 2014, and refused to cooperate with the investigation.











            Dutch prosecutors said that “there are strong indications that the Russian president decided on supplying” a Buk missile system — the weapon that downed MH17 — to Ukrainian separatists.

            “Although we speak of strong indications, the high bar of complete and conclusive evidence is not reached,"" Dutch prosecutor Digna van Boetzelaer said, adding that without Russian cooperation, “the investigation has now reached its limit. All leads have been exhausted.”

            She also said that, as head of state, Putin would have immunity from prosecution in the Netherlands. The team played a recording of an intercepted phone call in which they said Putin could be heard discussing the conflict in eastern Ukraine.

            “Are we disappointed? No, because we think we came further than we had ever thought in 2014. Would we have liked to come further? Of course, yes,” said Andy Kraag of the Dutch police.

            The team informed relatives of those killed in the downing of MH17 of their findings before making them public.

            “There was disappointment because ... they wanted to know why MH17 was shot down,"" Kraag said. ""We’re really clear on what has happened, but the answer to the question why MH17 was shot down still remains in Russia.”

            Van Boetzelaer said that while the investigation is being suspended, phone lines will remain open for possible witnesses who may still want to provide evidence. If that happens, the inquiry could be reactivated.

            Russian officials say that a decision to provide rebels with military support over the summer of 2014 was in Putin’s hands.

            A decision to supply arms was even postponed for a week “because there is only one who makes a decision (…), the person who is currently at a summit in France,” the investigative team said, citing a phone conversation that was referring to Putin.

            Prosecutors said that at the time Putin was at a commemoration of D-Day in France.

            The announcement by the investigative team comes nearly three months after a Dutch court convicted two Russians and a Ukrainian rebel for their roles in shooting down the plane. One Russian was acquitted by the court. 

            None of the suspects appeared for the trial and it was unclear if the three who were found guilty of multiple murders will ever serve their sentences.

            The convictions and the court's finding that the surface-to-air Buk missile came from a Russian military base were seen as a clear indication that Moscow had a role in the tragedy. Russia has always denied involvement. The Russian Foreign Ministry accused the court in November of bowing to pressure from Dutch politicians, prosecutors and the news media.

            But the November convictions held that Moscow was in overall control in 2014 over the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic, the separatist area of eastern Ukraine where the missile was launched. The Buk missile system came from the Russian military's 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade, based in the city of Kursk.

            The Joint Investigation Team is made up of experts from the Netherlands, Australia, Malaysia, Belgium and Ukraine. Most of the victims were Dutch. It had continued to investigate the crew of the missile system that brought down the plane and those who ordered its deployment in Ukraine.

            As well as the criminal trial that was held in the Netherlands, the Dutch and Ukrainian governments are suing Russia at the European Court of Human Rights over its alleged role in the downing of MH17.

            The findings revealed Wednesday will likely strengthen the case at the human rights court and could also be used by prosecutors at the International Criminal Court who are investigating possible war crimes in Ukraine dating to the start of the separatist conflict.

            Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese vowed to keep pursuing justice for 38 Australian citizens and residents who died aboard MH17, describing Putin as “reprehensible.”

            “The shooting down of MH17 was an act of terrorism that had an impact here in Australia but on many countries as well. And we will continue to pursue these issues with every avenue at our disposal,” Albanese said in the Australian capital Canberra.

            “This is a guy who runs an authoritarian regime, that doesn’t care about human rights, that doesn’t care about devastation of communities — whether it be in Ukraine, whether it be the oppression of his own citizens, or whether it be acts outside of Russia, of which we’ve seen a number,” Albanese added.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804191,Biden rallies workers in Wisconsin after big speech,"DeFOREST, Wis. (AP) — Fresh from his State of the Union address, President Joe Biden rallied supporters in Wisconsin on Wednesday, preparing for an expected reelection announcement this spring and trying to shore up the backing of working-class voters who have edged away from Democrats in recent years. 

            “Fighting for the sake of fighting gets us nowhere,” Biden said at a training facility run by the Laborers’ International Union of North America. “We’re getting things done.”

            Workers lined up in orange shirts and hard hats behind the president as he spoke. A banner that said “union strong” hung to the side.











            Biden, who beat Donald Trump in 2020 by a narrow margin in Wisconsin, talked about helping workers make “a couple more bucks"" and preventing them from “getting stiffed” by companies that “play us for suckers.”

            “My economic plan is about investing in people and places that feel forgotten,” said Biden, who pointed to new federal funding for a bridge and electric buses in Wisconsin. 

            His trip was one stop in the traditional post-State of the Union blitz, where the president, vice president and Cabinet officials fan out across the country to promote his themes from the speech. Biden's next stop is Tampa, Florida, on Thursday, where he's expected to discuss proposals to safeguard Social Security and Medicare, and lower the cost of health care.

            At the training center, Biden met workers and apprentices who are learning how to do the jobs that are being created as a result of several pieces of major legislation, some of them passed with Republican support, that Biden has signed into law. 

            The measures include trillions of dollars for pandemic relief, rebuilding roads, bridges and other infrastructure, jump-starting the semiconductor chip industry in the United States, and boosting climate change and health care initiatives. 

            ""He’s got us in his mind, and it’s good to hear,” said Casey Kvalo, an underground pipe worker from DeForest. As for the job creation Biden promoted Tuesday evening, “he’s right on point about it and it’s exciting to hear,” Kvalo said.

            Tony Kurkowski, a Milwaukee highway worker and union member, said he was “pleasantly surprised” by the president’s visit and focus on workers.

            “With a lot of politicians, it’s easy to take the vote for granted and once they get in have their own priorities, but it’s good to see he’s coming back to labor,” he said.

            Biden's State of the Union night also included heckling by some Republicans, who called him a “liar” and demanded that he “secure the border” with Mexico.

            Vice President Kamala Harris brushed off those interruptions in an interview with “CBS Mornings” before jetting to Atlanta for her own event on Wednesday. 

            “The president was in command and he focused on the American people as opposed to necessarily the gamesmanship that was being played in the room,"" she said. 

            In her remarks at Georgia Tech, Harris touted investments in the green economy and the administration's fight against damage from climate change. 

            “We’re looking at at least a trillion dollars to hit the streets of America to address some of these issues,” she said.

            She declared that this is “a moment where we should think of it not being about incremental change and slowly moving the needle but embarking, jumping onto a new plateau” and “establishing a whole new industry, a clean-energy economy.”

            Biden has said he intends to run for a second term in 2024. A formal announcement is expected in the coming months, though a majority of Democrats now think one term is plenty, according to a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804192,Former Croatian national team coach Blazevic dies at 87,"ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) — Miroslav “Ciro” Blazevic, who coached the Croatian national soccer team to the semifinals of the 1998 World Cup in France, has died. He was 87.

            His family and friends said Blazevic died at a Zagreb hospital on Wednesday after a long battle with prostate cancer.

            The “coach of all coaches,” as he was known in his home country of Croatia, led four national teams and several domestic and foreign clubs during his career.











            Born into a Catholic family in Travnik, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Blazevic was an average player. His successful coaching career started in the 1960s, in the same place where his playing days ended — at Swiss club Vevey.

            Blazevic also led the national teams of Iran, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Switzerland. Among the clubs he coached were Dinamo Zagreb, Nantes, Grasshopper Zurich, Sion, Shanghai Shenhua, PAOK Thessaloniki and Hajduk Split.

            The pinnacle of his coaching career came at the 1998 World Cup in France when Croatia finished in third place only a few years after emerging from the bloody breakup of former Yugoslavia.

            “The whole country was proud, but I was sad,” Blazevic said recently about the 1998 success. “If I had the experience I have now, we would have been the world champions.”

            He won over the crowds in France by wearing a policeman’s hat on the bench in honor of a French officer who was put in a coma by German hooligans early on in the tournament.

            A colorful public persona, Blazevic — who was known in the 1980s for always wearing a white scarf when in public — also had a stint in politics by unsuccessfully running for Croatia’s presidency in a 2005 election when he won less than 1% of the vote.

            “Some people from high politics have persuaded me to run for the presidency as they are sure I could win,” Blazevic, a fierce right-wing sympathizer, said at the time. “As for the 10,000 signatures necessary to endorse my bid, I could collect them simply by turning up at any soccer game and ask the fans to sign their names.”

            He was to celebrate his 88th birthday on Thursday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804206,Taiwan nonprofit in Turkey turns itself into shelter for earthquake victims,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The Taiwan-Reyhanli Center for World Citizens (Taiwan Center), a Taiwan-funded civic organization in Turkey, located less than 200 kilometers from the epicenter of the Feb. 6 earthquake, has turned itself into a shelter for earthquake victims, providing them with accommodations, hot food, and electricity.The 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck southeastern Turkey and northwestern Syria and the death toll has reportedly reached over 7,000 people.Taiwan Center director Chiu Chen-yu (裘振宇) said in an online press conference Wednesday that Reyhanli, located in Turkey’s Hatay Province near the country's border with Syria, was currently cut off from the outside world, with almost no water and electricity, CNA reported. The center’s staff were currently collecting diesel with which to generate electricity.Without any outside aid, Chiu estimated that the center will be able to operate for about one to two weeks.He said that there were currently no ambulances or police cars in the area, and many residents had come to the Taiwan Center for help, per CNA. In addition to accommodating disaster victims and providing hot food, the center also has electricity for people to charge their mobile phones.The Taiwan Center has a generator donated by the United Nations to provide electricity and a groundwater well to provide water, Chiu was quoted by CNA as saying.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804220,Russia vows to boost military cooperation with Mali,"While on a visit to the West African country where he held talks with his Malian counterpart Abdoulaye Diop and interim leader Colonel Assimi Goita, Russia's top envoy Sergey Lavrov praised the bilateral relations between Moscow and Bamako.""Last year and at the beginning of this year, a large consignment of Russian aviation equipmentwas sent, thanks to which the National Army of Mali has recently managed to carry out successful operations in the fight against terrorists, who still remain active on Malian territory,"" Lavrov said.""The second batch of aircraft for these purposes was delivered quite recently, on January 19.""According to the military authorities of the transition, this is the first time a head of the Russian diplomacy has visited Mali. On the other hand, it is Lavrov's third trip to Africa since July 2022, part of a bid to expand Russia's presence on the continent amid broad international isolation after Moscow invaded Ukraine last year.The meeting comes in the wake of a call last week by the United Nations for an independent investigation into possible war crimes and crimes against humanity by government forces and Russian private military contractor Wagner Group in Mali.Apart from military and defense ties, Mali seeks to reinforce its economic cooperation with Russia and get preferential access to essential products.At a joint press conference, Lavrov further stressed that Russia ""will continue to provide the necessary support to our friends not only in matters of economic and trade development but also with humanitarian assistance.""""Our Malian friends have specific wishes in this respect; they are systematically satisfied,"" Lavrov said.Since coming to power in a 2020 coup, Mali's ruling military, the junta has turned to Moscow even as it sparred with neighbors and Western nations over election delays and its decision to work with Russian mercenaries to combat an Islamist insurgency.Last year, Russian President Vladimir Putin told Mali that Moscow was committed to strengthening cooperation to help eliminate the militants. It also promised fuel, fertilizer, and food shipments worth around $100 million (€93 million).""We welcome all the steps taken by the authorities of the Russian Federation to create preferential conditions for my country to have access to basic necessities in a particularly difficult global economic context,"" Mali's foreign minister Abdoulaye Diop told reporters.Mali's growing friendliness with Russia has coincided with a breakdown in relations with France, the country's former colonial power. Last year, the rift led Paris to withdraw all its troops battling militants since 2013.Diop said the collaboration with Russia had delivered tangible results in defense and national security as Mali continued its battle against insurgents.Western governments are worried about the involvement in Mali of Russian private military contractor Wagner, which is also fighting alongside the Russian army in Ukraine.Late in January, the US Treasury Department designated the Wagner Group a significant transnational criminal organization as it bid to crack down on an entity responsible for atrocities in Ukraine. Fighters of the Wagner Group, who have also appeared in Syria, are notorious for the brutality of their tactics.Referring to Western criticism and the Wagner group, Lavrov downplayed the accusations, adding that he ""was not aware of any UN experts who would be empowered to consider any aspect of war crimes, whoever committed them.""Despite such criticism, the Malian foreign ministry said in an earlier statement, as quoted by Reuters, that ""this high-level visit is in line with the political choice made by the Transitional Government to expand and diversify strategic partnerships.""Lavrov's visit shows ""the firm will of the Malian and Russian heads of state to give new impetus to the relations of friendship and bilateral cooperation ... in priority areas, particularly defense, and security,"" the ministry said.After the proclamation of its independence on September 22, 1960, Mali established its first contact with Russia in economic, social, and cultural cooperation.According to Daouda Tekete, author of the book Modibo Keita - portrait inédit du président (father of Malian independence, editor's note), ""after the departure of the last French troops from Mali, on February 21, 1961, the Malian government sent a delegation to Moscow that signed the first agreements between Mali and the then Soviet Union.As part of the agreement, Moscow equipped Mali with heavy weapons, fighter planes, and everything that Modibo Keita, Mali's first post-independence president, left as a legacy for the Malian army.- On June 25, 2019, Russia and Mali concluded, on the sidelines of the Army 2019 forum, held near Moscow, a military cooperation agreement signed by the Ministers of Defense of both countries.In November 2022, on the sidelines of the visit of Mali's Minister of Security, Daoud Aly Mohammedine, to Moscow, Mali and Russia signed a cooperation agreement on security, intelligence, risk and disaster management, counter-narcotics, and personnel training.Alexis Kalembry, journalist and publication director at Mali Tribune, told DW that Mali is particularly interested in choosing the Russian camp in a divided world that has pitted the west against Russia because it invaded Ukraine.""One might be tempted to say that the world is repolarizing. And with the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, every country has to reposition itself. Russia is becoming a pole around which all those who see the world differently are clustering. I believe that this is a wave on which Mali can surf.""Edited by: Chrispin Mwakideu",2023/2/8,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804221,North Korea: Kim Jong Un visits troops with daughter,"North Korean leader Kim Jong Un brought his daughter to an event ahead of the 75th founding anniversary of the country's army, where he lauded his troops as the ""strongest army in the world,"" state media reported on Wednesday.This was the fourth known public appearance of Kim Ju Ae, aged around 9 or 10 years old. She was dressed just like her father in a black suit and white dress shirt, and walked down the red carpet holding his hand. Her mother and Kim's wife, Ri Sol Ju, was also present.At the banquet held at the lodging quarters of the Korean People's Army's general officers, Kim praised the ""irresistible might"" of his nuclear-armed military, the official KCNA reported.Kim Ju Ae's reference in state media as ""respected"" and ""beloved"" has sparked rumors that she is being groomed to succeed her father.The increasing amount of public outings with his wife and daughter mark a significant shift from Kim's earlier apperances and those of his father — under whose authoritarian regime the leader's immediate family was rarely seen.On Wednesday, North Korea will mark the 75th founding anniversary of the Korean People's Army.Pyongyang is widely expected to stage a massive military parade to mark the occasion.The event will serve as an opportunity to display the newest hardware of its rapidly expanding nuclear weapons program, causing concern among neighboring countries and the United States.Last year, North Korea conducted a record number of military tests firing more than 70 ballistic missiles. These comprised of nuclear-capable weapons with the ability to hit targets in South Korea or reach the mainland of the US.North Korea has been critical of US military presence in the region and joint military exercises between the US and South Korea, threatening to answer with the ""most overwhelming nuclear force.""Despite Kim not mentioning the US or rival South Korea in the speech to his troops, an editorial in the official newspaper Rodong Sinmun on Wednesday stated that the North's military is ready to launch a ""super strong strike of unimaginable might to wipe out the origins of provocations without a trace.""ss/es (AP, EFE)",2023/2/8,,

And we did,"" Biden added.In reaction to the speech, China said it would ""firmly defend"" its interests and urged the United States to work on repairing relations.""We will firmly defend China's sovereignty, security, and development interests,"" Mao Ning said.lo/es (AFP, AP, dpa, Reuters)",2023/2/8,,

He visited the United States, with a stopover in Poland, in December.The UK is one of Ukraine's biggest military backers and has sent the country more than £2 billion (€2,25 billion, $2,5 billion) in weapons and equipment.The trip comes as Ukrainian officials escalated their public lobbying campaign for Western fighter jets.Sunak would offer Ukrainian pilots ""NATO-standard fighter jets.''""I am proud that today we will expand that training from soldiers to marines and fighter jet pilots, ensuring Ukraine has a military able to defend its interests well into the future,"" Sunak said in a statement.""It also underlines our commitment to not just provide military equipment for the short term, but a long-term pledge to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Ukraine for years to come.''The United States and Germany have ruled out supplying Ukraine with F-16s.However, the Baltic nations and Poland have given their backing to the idea of providing Kyiv with warplanes.""Ukraine needs fighter jets ... missiles, tanks.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804228,"Millie Bright: 'We're not robots, our bodies will break down'","Millie Bright is a woman in demand. As she sits down to meet DW at Chelsea's plush training ground on the outskirts of London, she apologizes that the interview is starting 10 minutes late. An advertising commitment after training overran. It's no surprise, as the England defender is generous with her time. After this, she'll get straight on to a call with a national newspaper.As vice-captain of Women's Super League (WSL) winners Chelsea and European champions England, she had a monumental 2022. But with Chelsea soon resuming their hunt for a first Champions League title, a meeting with London rivals Arsenal in the FA Cup and England's World Cup warmups all starting within the next month or so, there's not likely to be any let up.A FIFPRO survey ahead of Euro 2022 found that the central defender had played more minutes than any other player at the tournament in the season that preceded it. She played every second of England's campaign and barely misses a minute at the club level. On the face of it, it's a problem many players would love. But there are drawbacks.""Our schedules are way more demanding now. We're expected to do tournament after tournament after tournament whilst competing for every trophy when you play in those top end clubs. It's impossible to keep going and we're not robots, our bodies are going to break down,"" she says.""Whether you're male or female, the scheduling has to be able to allow the players to perform at the highest level week in week out, year in year out. Because eventually players are going to burn out and that's when you start getting fatigue and then injuries. Playing on when you're fatigued is not a good thing.""A spate of injuries to high-profile female footballers in a season bookended by continental tournaments and the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand, combined with the explosive growth in the women's game, has seen demands on players like Bright skyrocket.The 29-year-old sees a responsibility to continue to aid that growth from her leadership position but admits that sometimes ""we almost want to do too much."" The balance between capitalizing on the feelgood factor of England's home tournament win and the upcoming World Cup and making sure it's sustainable can be precarious. Particularly for a physical defender who relished reporting that she'd just been giving teammate Sam Kerr a rough ride in training.""I'm very stubborn as a player and as a person. It's hard for me to say I'm not ready, because I would give an arm and a leg for club and country, and I would play every single minute available. But I've learned what my body needs. And if there comes a time when it is too much, then I'd have to be smart in that moment and say, 'You know what, I think I need an extra day's recovery.' And I'm really blessed to be in a club that allows us to do that.""With Chelsea leading a number of challengers in the WSL, Bright may not be afforded too many rest days in the coming months. And she certainly won't want them in Europe either. Despite the newly found wealth of the English competition, no English side has won the Champions League since Arsenal in 2007. Indeed the only other side to get to the final were Bright's Chelsea, who were beaten 4-0 by Barcelona in 2021.Despite that defeat, and that record, Bright says her team now feel more comfortable believing they can win it.""Before, looking back in that moment, of course, everyone always says we're here to win. But I think when you look back and you're realistic, we were just competing. For us now though, I think it's that mentality of just being fearless. And knowing that we've got the squad to go all the way.""Friday's draw will play a part, with Bayern Munich one of three teams Chelsea can draw after winning a group that also contained Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain. Bright isn't expecting too much information from Bayern's Lioness Georgia Stanway, but she sees Bayern as a ""real threat.""The same was true of Germany's star striker Alexandra Popp ahead of the Euros final. When one of the tournament's best players pulled out after sustaining an injury in the warmup at Wembley, many could be forgiven for that thinking Bright would be relieved. Not a bit of it.""I was absolutely gutted,"" she says. ""She's an unbelievable player, she's always been really fiery on the pitch. Never malicious but always a really good competitor when I've played against her in the Champions League. So I was really gutted she was unable to start that game.""I love that battle, that competitiveness and I was just really looking forward to that challenge on the biggest stage.""She may yet have that chance, with both Germany and England among the leading contenders for the World Cup, and Popp's Wolfsburg a potential opponent in the last four or the finals of the Champions League. But those challenges are too far off to occupy Bright's mind just now. There's more than enough to do before that.Edited by: Jonathan Harding",2023/2/8,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804231,Ex-Twitter execs deny pressure to block Hunter Biden story,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Former Twitter executives conceded Wednesday they made a mistake by blocking a story about Hunter Biden, the president’s son, from the social media platform in the run-up to the 2020 election, but adamantly denied Republican assertions they were pressured by Democrats and law enforcement to suppress the story.

            “The decisions here aren’t straightforward, and hindsight is 20/20,” Yoel Roth, Twitter's former head of trust and safety, testified to Congress. “It isn’t obvious what the right response is to a suspected, but not confirmed, cyberattack by another government on a presidential election.”

            He added, “Twitter erred in this case because we wanted to avoid repeating the mistakes of 2016.” 











            The three former executives appeared before the House Oversight and Accountability Committee to testify for the first time about the company’s decision to initially block from Twitter a New York Post article in October 2020 about the contents of a laptop belonging to Hunter Biden. 

            Emboldened by Twitter's new leadership in billionaire Elon Musk — whom they see as more sympathetic to conservatives than the company's previous administration — Republicans used the hearing to push a long-standing and unproven theory that social media companies including Twitter are biased against them. 

            Committee Chairman Rep. James Comer said the hearing is the panel's ""first step in examining the coordination between the federal government and Big Tech to restrict protected speech and interfere in the democratic process."" 

            The hearing continues a years-long trend of GOP leaders calling tech company leaders to testify about alleged political bias. Democrats, meanwhile, have pressed the companies on the spread of hate speech and misinformation on their platforms. 

            The witnesses Republicans subpoenaed were Roth, Vijaya Gadde, Twitter's former chief legal officer, and James Baker, the company's former deputy general counsel.

            Democrats brought a witness of their own, Anika Collier Navaroli, a former employee with Twitter's content moderation team. She testified last year to the House committee that investigated the Jan. 6 Capitol riot about Twitter's preferential treatment of Donald Trump until it banned the then-president from the site two years ago.

            The White House criticized congressional Republicans for staging “a bizarre political stunt,” hours after Biden's State of the Union address where he detailed bipartisan progress in his first two years in office. 

            “This appears to be the latest effort by the House Republican majority’s most extreme MAGA members to question and relitigate the outcome of the 2020 election,"" White House spokesperson Ian Sams said in a statement Wednesday. “This is not what the American people want their leaders to work on.”

            The New York Post reported weeks before the 2020 presidential election that it had received from Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, a copy of a hard drive from a laptop that Hunter Biden had dropped off 18 months earlier at a Delaware computer repair shop and never retrieved. Twitter blocked people from sharing links to the story for several days.

            “You exercised an amazing amount of clout and power over the entire American electorate by even holding (this story) hostage for 24 hours and then reversing your policy,” Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., said to the panel of witnesses. 

            Months later, Twitter’s then-CEO, Jack Dorsey, called the company’s communications around the Post article “not great.” He added that blocking the article’s URL with “zero context” around why it was blocked was “unacceptable.”

            The newspaper story was greeted at the time with skepticism due to questions about the laptop’s origins, including Giuliani’s involvement, and because top officials in the Trump administration had already warned that Russia was working to denigrate Joe Biden before the White House election. 

            The Kremlin interfered in the 2016 race by hacking Democratic emails that were subsequently leaked, and fears that Russia would meddle again in the 2020 race were widespread across Washington.

            Just last week, lawyers for the younger Biden asked the Justice Department to investigate people who say they accessed his personal data. But they did not acknowledge that the data came from a laptop Hunter Biden is purported to have dropped off at a computer repair shop.

            The issue was also reignited recently after Musk took over Twitter as CEO and began to release a slew of company information to independent journalists, what he has called the “Twitter Files.”

            The documents and data largely show internal debates among employees over the decision to temporarily censor links to the Hunter Biden story. The tweet threads lacked substantial evidence of a targeted influence campaign from Democrats or the FBI, which has denied any involvement in Twitter's decision-making.

            Rep. Dan Goldman, D-N.Y., called the hearing a “fishing expedition” seeking to reheat bogus allegations claiming Biden somehow influenced his son’s business dealings in Ukraine. 

            Nonetheless, Republicans including Comer, R-Ky., have used the Post story, which has not been independently verified by The Associated Press, as the basis for what they claim is another example of the Biden family's “influence peddling.""

            One of Wednesday's witnesses, Baker, has been a frequent target of Republican scrutiny. 

            Baker was the FBI’s general counsel during the opening of two of the bureau’s most consequential investigations in history: the Hillary Clinton investigation and a separate inquiry into potential coordination between Russia and Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. Republicans have long criticized the FBI’s handling of both investigations. 

            Baker denied any wrongdoing during his two years at Twitter and said that despite disagreeing with the decision to block links to the Post story, “I believe that the public record reveals that my client acted in a manner that was fully consistent with the First Amendment.”

            There has been no evidence that Twitter’s platform is biased against conservatives; studies have found the opposite when it comes to conservative media in particular. But the issue continues to preoccupy GOP members of congress. 

            And some experts said questions around government influence on Big Tech's content moderation are legitimate. 

            “Despite how I would change how some of the members ask their questions, there should be more insight into this stuff. There should be more transparency,"" said Katie Harbath, a fellow at the Bipartisan Policy Center who served as Facebook’s former public policy director. 

            She added, “There’s still a lot more hearings and sides to the story that we need to hear from, particularly the government and the FBI.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804232,Sweden: Anti-Turkish protests have increased attack threat,"STOCKHOLM (AP) — The Swedish domestic security agency warned Wednesday that the threat of attacks in the Scandinavian country has increased in the weeks since a far-right activist burned a Quran outside the Turkish Embassy in Stockholm.

            The agency noted that international reactions to the events outside the embassy last month"" have been extensive” and “the assessment is that the security situation has deteriorated.” 

            ""Sweden is judged to be in greater focus than before for violent Islamism globally,” the security service, which is known by the Swedish acronym SAPO, said.











            The security agency, however, did not change Sweden's terror threat level, which already stood at three on a five-point scale. 

            Its statement came at time of tensions with mostly Muslim Turkey over the applications of Sweden and Finland to become NATO members.

            Turkey is angry that Sweden has allowed anti-Turkish protests to take place, and particularly that it did not prevent an anti-Islam activist from burning the Quran, the Muslim holy book. The Turkish government also claims Sweden is not doing enough to counter Kurdish activists that it considers terrorists. 

            Unless its demands are met, Turkey has said it won’t approve Sweden’s NATO application, which requires ratification by all of the military alliance’s 30 members.

            Later Wednesday, police in Stockholm said they had turned down an application for permission to burn the Quran during a new protest, saying that “such a gathering is judged to be capable of causing serious disturbances to national security.” Police said the decision was made in consultation with SAPO.

            The police didn’t say when the protest had been scheduled for or who had sought permission — which is needed in Sweden. Swedish broadcaster SVT said it was to have been staged outside the Turkish Embassy on Thursday.

            On Sunday, the U.S. Embassy in Stockholm issued a warning of “possible retaliatory attacks by terrorists in the wake of recent Quran-burning incidents in Europe.

            In its security assessment, SAPO also cited a disinformation campaign that claims Swedish social service agencies kidnap Muslim children.

            Last week, Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said the government would post guards inside social services offices and earmark more funds to the Swedish Psychological Defense Agency, which was established to counter misinformation.

            In a Feb. 3 notice to the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights in Uganda's capital Kampala, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs asserted that local authorities have “the capacity to monitor the promotion and protection of human rights throughout the country.”

            From now on Uganda's government will deal directly with the Geneva headquarters of the U.N. rights office, stated the letter that has been seen by The Associated Press. Ugandan officials confirmed the letter is authentic. 











            Nicholas Opiyo, a prominent rights attorney in Uganda, described the decision as “unfortunate,"" saying in a Twitter post that he hoped it was just a misunderstanding that could be resolved. 

            The U.N. rights office in Kampala has been operational since 2006. In recent years its offices have been the scene of some protests by activists and others trying to highlight rights violations allegedly perpetrated by Ugandan state agents. Allegations have included torture and disappearances. 

            In one violent incident after Uganda's presidential polls in 2021, police roughed up journalists who had gone to the office to cover an opposition party's efforts to present a petition alleging abuses by security forces. 

            Opposition figure Bobi Wine says many of his supporters remain in illegal detention and has urged the international community to put more pressure on Ugandan authorities over rights concerns.

High Commissioner for Human Rights in Uganda's capital Kampala, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs asserted that local authorities have “the capacity to monitor the promotion and protection of human rights throughout the country.”From now on Uganda's government will deal directly with the Geneva headquarters of the U.N. rights office, stated the letter that has been seen by The Associated Press. Ugandan officials confirmed the letter is authentic.Nicholas Opiyo, a prominent rights attorney in Uganda, described the decision as “unfortunate,"" saying in a Twitter post that he hoped it was just a misunderstanding that could be resolved.The U.N. rights office in Kampala has been operational since 2006. In recent years its offices have been the scene of some protests by activists and others trying to highlight rights violations allegedly perpetrated by Ugandan state agents. Allegations have included torture and disappearances.In one violent incident after Uganda's presidential polls in 2021, police roughed up journalists who had gone to the office to cover an opposition party's efforts to present a petition alleging abuses by security forces.Opposition figure Bobi Wine says many of his supporters remain in illegal detention and has urged the international community to put more pressure on Ugandan authorities over rights concerns.Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, a U.S. ally on regional security, has held power since 1986.",2023/2/8,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804242,Primary care a hot target; CVS spends $10.6B on Oak Street,"Big money is pouring into primary care clinics as the nation’s health care giants hunt for ways to cut costs by keeping people healthy.

            CVS Health said Wednesday that it will spend about $10.6 billion to buy Oak Street Health, which runs clinics that specialize in treating Medicare Advantage patients. 

            The acquisition comes just three months after a nearly $9-billion investment by rival Walgreens in VillageMD’s acquisition of the urgent and primary care chain Summit Health-CityMD. And that deal was announced two months after CVS said it would spend $8 billion to acquire home health care provider Signify Health. 











            The money being spent tells of a rapid expansion in value-based care, an approach to medicine that is growing popular with bill payers like the federal government’s Medicare program.

            It essentially rewards doctors for keeping patients healthy instead of paying them for every service they perform. The idea is to help people stay on their regular medications, control chronic health problems such as diabetes, and avoid hospital stays and other expensive medical treatments.

            “It is clear that value-based-care is becoming a dominant model in healthcare,” BTIG analyst David Larsen said in a recent research note.

            Oak Street specializes in this care. Its centers use doctors, social workers and other care providers to help people manage their health.

            Oak Street CEO Michael Pykosz has said that a lot of costs stem from patients with chronic health issues who receive poor care and wind up with big medical problems. 

            “Solving that problem creates a massive, massive market opportunity for Oak Street Health,” Pykosz said in January at an annual conference hosted by JPMorgan.

            CVS Health CEO Karen Lynch told analysts Wednesday that she sees primary care as a key to improving patient health. She noted that although it represents only about 10% of health care spending nationally, the specialty holds “significant influence” over health care use.

            Oak Street runs care centers mostly for lower-to-middle income people with Medicare Advantage plans. Those are privately run versions of the federal government’s program for people aged 65 and older.

            Founded in 2012, Oak Street operates 169 locations in 21 states. It expects to have more than 300 locations by 2026.

            Oak Street’s revenue grew to $1.43 billion in 2021, and analysts expect that it topped $2 billion last year. But the company is spending heavily to open new clinics, and its losses have grown every year.

            CVS Health Corp. leaders have been talking for well over a year about adding more primary care as rivals that also include UnitedHealth Group beef up their medical staffs.

            In addition to running drugstores, CVS Health also covers more than 3 million people with Medicare Advantage plans. Big insurers like that need a major presence in primary care to help control costs, Larsen said.

            He added in a note Wednesday that the price CVS Health was willing to pay for Oak Street probably climbed due to a potential tightening of Medicare reimbursement and a competitive market that includes Amazon.com. 

            Two months before CVS's Signify deal, Amazon said it would spend roughly $3.9 billion to buy care provider One Medical. Regulators are still reviewing that deal.

            CVS Health said Wednesday it would pay $39 per share in cash for each share of Oak Street in a deal expected to close this year. 

            CVS Health also announced on Wednesday better-than-expected results from the final quarter of 2022. The Woonsocket, Rhode Island, company’s profit surged 76% in the quarter to $2.3 billion. Adjusted earnings totaled $1.99 per share. 

            Total revenue climbed 9% to $83.85 billion.

            Analysts expected earnings of $1.92 per share on $76.32 billion in revenue, according to FactSet.

            The company also said it still expects 2023 adjusted earnings to range between $8.70 and $8.90 per share. CVS Health leaders first laid out that forecast last November.

            Analysts forecast earnings of $8.84 per share. 

            Shares of both CVS Health and Chicago-based Oak Street Health Inc. climbed more than 4% Wednesday while broader indexes slipped.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804243,Minor league hockey game a forfeit after home team no-shows,"Fans filed into the rink for a minor league hockey game, vendors sold concessions and the visiting team took the ice for warmups. The national anthem played, and officials were ready to drop the puck.

            One problem: The home team did not show up.

            This bizarre scene unfolded over the weekend at what was supposed to be a Southern Professional Hockey League game in Danville, Illinois, between the visiting Quad City Storm and host Vermilion County Bobcats. After a 2-minute delay of game penalty and 5-minute waiting period, the game was declared a forfeit. The visitors tried to give fans their money's worth by inviting them onto the ice for what was supposed to be a postgame group skate before making the three-hour drive home.











            “It was a very weird weekend,” Quad City president Brian Rothenberger said. “Certainly one of the most bizarre (things) I’ve seen.”

            There are now concerns last-place Vermilion County, which has lost 77 of 86 games in its two years of existence, will fold midseason. That would reduce the number of teams from 11 to 10 in the SPHL, which is a rung below the ECHL in the North American hockey hierarchy, after the NHL and American Hockey League.

            Multiple messages seeking details, clarification and comment on the situation Sunday and moving forward sent to the SPHL, the team and owner Ellen Tully were not returned.

            The only public announcement read: “The Southern Professional Hockey League (SPHL) on Sunday announced the Quad City at Vermilion County game scheduled for Sunday, February 5 has been declared a forfeit in favor of Quad City pursuant to Rule 73.3 of the SPHL Rule Book.”

            If this is the end for the latest attempt at minor professional hockey in the Eastern Illinois city of just under 30,000 located 93 miles (150 kilometers) from Indianapolis, the Bobcats went out in viral fashion. Videos showing the surreal development of one team standing on one half of the rink compared to the empty bench, net and ice on the other side made their way on to social media with fans decrying the embarrassment of the situation.

            Chuck Sergent, a hockey lifer in Danville who said he worked as vice president and head of marketing and public relations for Vermilion County from August-December, “was not surprised that it happened at all.” He had known of deteriorating conditions within the team, including concerns over inadequate medical personnel on site for games, and figured a problem was imminent when the Bobcats were replaced as the opponent for road games at Quad City on Friday and Saturday.

            Rothenberger and owner John Dawson accompanied players and coaches on this trip because they knew the circumstances might be a little bit strange. Rothenberger said the league told the Storm to go about their regular business and take the ice as usual because that was standard procedure.

            Fans who weren't paying close attention didn't know what was coming. Sergent had a good idea, and he wanted to be at David S. Palmer Arena to talk to season-ticket holders he brought in during his stint with the club.

            “It hurt me so bad to watch the arena, which was not their fault, keep selling tickets to a game that they had a gut feeling and knowing darn well it wasn’t going to happen,” he said. “It’s sad.”

            Vermilion County’s coach did not show up, there was no athletic trainer on site and Sergent said only one player was prepared to take the ice.

            While the official attendance was listed at 0, fans who paid $7-13 per ticket for a game that never happened still got to step onto the ice to skate with visiting players from Quad City who stuck around to provide some entertainment.

            “That is really what minor pro sports is all about,” Rothenberger said, adding the team stopped for McDonalds and “some cold beverages” for the ride home. “They were excited to be able to do it. I think it meant a lot to the fans that were there, especially some of the younger kids looking forward to that skate. They still got to do it and hope that can kind of keep that hockey interest up and see if they can move forward getting things, a little more stability, I guess, there in Vermilion County moving forward.”

            Sergent, who was involved with previous teams in Danville — the Dashers of the Federal Prospects Hockey League and Wings of the North American Hockey League — expects Vermillion County ""won’t play another game.

            “They’re absolutely done,” he said. “After what happened (Sunday) and what they did to the fan base, they’re done.”

            As of Tuesday afternoon, tickets were still on sale online for the team's remaining home and road games.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804244,Toxic gases connected to Ohio train derailment cause concern,"Days after crews released and burned toxic chemicals transported by a wrecked train in Ohio, residents remain concerned about the toxic substances that could be lingering in their evacuated neighborhoods.

            About 50 cars, including 10 carrying hazardous materials, derailed in a fiery crash Friday in East Palestine, according to rail operator Norfolk Southern and the National Transportation Safety Board. Vinyl chloride was slowly released into the air Monday from five of those cars before crews ignited it to get rid of the highly flammable, toxic chemicals in a controlled environment, creating a dark plume of smoke.

            Residents in the immediate area there and nearby in Pennsylvania were evacuated beforehand because of health risks from the fumes and can’t yet return Wednesday, as the impact of burning vinyl chloride is a concern.











            WHAT IS VINYL CHLORIDE?

            The gas is used to make the polyvinyl chloride hard plastic resin in plastic products. It is found in products such as credit cards, furniture and car parts, but is most notably used in PVC plastic piping, a common material for plumbing.

            IS IT DANGEROUS?

            Vinyl chloride is associated with increased risk of liver cancer and other cancers, according to the federal government’s National Cancer Institute.

            The effect was studied in PVC pipe makers, who breathed in vinyl chloride and developed rare liver cancers, said Ruth Lunn, who studies carcinogens at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.

            “If you worked longer, you had a higher risk, and if your exposure levels were high, you had a higher risk,"" Lunn said.

            Vinyl chloride is dozens of times less toxic per molecule than the U.S.-banned insecticide DDT but more dangerous per part than ammonia and natural gas, according to federal regulations that dictate acceptable levels in the air.

            WHAT HAPPENS WHEN IT BURNS?

            Officials warned the controlled burn would send phosgene and hydrogen chloride into the air. Phosgene is a highly toxic, colorless gas with a strong odor that can cause vomiting and breathing trouble and was used as a weapon in World War I.

            Phosgene is considered safe at 0.1 parts per million during an eight-hour exposure, or 0.2 ppm for a 15-minute exposure. The eight-hour exposure threshold would have to be even lower when measuring inside people’s homes, where residents often spend more than eight consecutive hours.

            Hydrogen chloride is a colorless to yellowish gas with a strong odor and its primarily effect on humans is skin, eye, nose and throat irritation. It is considered safe at 5 ppm for an eight-hour exposure.

            Neil Donahue, a professor chemistry at Carnegie Mellon University in nearby Pittsburgh, said he worries that the burning could have formed dioxins, which are created from burning chlorinated carbon materials.

            “Vinyl chloride is bad, dioxins are worse as carcinogens and that comes from burning,” Donahue said.

            Dioxins are a group of persistent environmental pollutants that last in the ground and body for years and have been one of the major environmental problems and controversies in the United States.

            Dr. Lynn Goldman, dean of George Washington University's School of Public Health, agrees this is a possible risk, but is more concerned about uncombusted vinyl chloride vapors that could be lurking in the immediate vicinity.

            ""Until there has been a thorough assessment, the soot as well as any other materials should in my opinion be treated as contaminated by vinyl chloride and/or dioxins or other contaminants until proven otherwise,” she said. 

            WHAT IS BEING MONITORED?

            James Justice of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said a network of air station monitors inside and outside the evacuation zone was collecting samples and that none of their readings found anything to be concerned about. “We want to make sure that’s not going to change,” he said.

            Justice said the agency is still working with experts to determine safe levels for various gases before reopening the evacuation zone. The incident response team did not specify what substances they are monitoring.

            The gases that experts suspect are in the area are heavier than air, which means they could be sitting in low-lying areas if not completely dissipated.

            National Guard members wearing protective gear are taking readings inside homes, basements and businesses, Major General John Harris Jr. said.

            The EPA also sampled nearby rivers to determine whether there has been any water contamination and is awaiting results.

            WHEN WILL THE RISK BE OVER?

            Whatever chemicals are in the air, gases largely dissipate fairly rapidly when out in the open, said George Gray, a public health professor at George Washington University. “Sunlight can change that, the movement of air can change that, temperature can change that,” Gray said.

            Residents are concerned about long-term effects of low-grade exposure.

            “There’s all that smoke and all those chemicals in there,"" said Mason Shields, who lives in East Palestine and visited an aid center outside the evacuation zone. “I’m wondering if it’s even going to be safe for people to return within the next week or month or however long.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804246,Bayern hires goalkeeping coach Rechner from Hoffenheim,"MUNICH (AP) — Bayern Munich signed goalkeeping coach Michael Rechner from Bundesliga rival Hoffenheim on Wednesday to replace the fired Toni Tapalović.

            The Bavarian club said the 42-year-old Rechner was joining the team's staff, but didn’t give any details regarding the length of his contract.

            Bayern fired Tapalović on Jan. 23 because of what sporting director Hasan Salihamidžić said were “differences over the ways and means of working together.”











            It led to strong criticism from injured goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, who had been working with Tapalović since they were both at Schalke. Neuer and Tapalović joined Bayern together in 2011 and Neuer said his dismissal was “the worst thing I’ve experienced in my career.”

            Tapalović did not get along with Bayern coach Julian Nagelsmann, whose relationship with Neuer is reportedly cool.

            Rechner, a former goalkeeper for VfR and Waldhof Mannheim, Sachsen Leipzig, Schweinfurt and others, started coaching with Hoffenheim’s under-19 team in 2008. He switched to the club’s under-23 team five years later and took over as the senior team’s goalkeeping coach in 2015.

            “We really regret his departure,” said Hoffenheim sporting director Alexander Rosen, who described Rechner’s move to Bayern as “the end of an era.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804248,Indonesian security forces search for NZ pilot taken hostage,"JAYAPURA, Indonesia (AP) — Indonesian security forces searched Wednesday for a pilot from New Zealand who was taken hostage by separatist rebels in restive Papua province.

            The joint team of soldiers and police searching for the pilot, Philip Mark Mehrtens, also managed Wednesday to rescue 15 construction workers who had been building a health center in Paro village in remote Nduga district after separatist rebels threatened to kill them, regional military commander Brig. Gen. J.O. Sembiring said.

            Mehrtens, from Christchurch, was captured early Tuesday by independence fighters from the West Papua Liberation Army, the armed wing of the Free Papua Organization, who stormed his single-engine plane shortly after it landed at Paro's small airport.











            The plane, operated by Indonesian aviation company Susi Air, was carrying five passengers and about 450 kilograms (990 pounds) of supplies from Timika, a mining town in neighboring Mimika district.

            The rebels released the indigenous Papuan passengers and set fire to the plane, rebel spokesperson Sebby Sambom said.

            “We will never release the pilot we are holding hostage unless Indonesia recognizes our sovereignty and frees Papua from Indonesian colonialism,” Sambom said in a statement Tuesday.

            Conflicts between indigenous Papuans and Indonesian security forces are common in the impoverished Papua region, a former Dutch colony in the western part of New Guinea that is ethnically and culturally distinct from much of Indonesia. Papua was incorporated into Indonesia in 1969 after a U.N.-sponsored ballot that was widely seen as a sham. Since then, a low-level insurgency has simmered in the mineral-rich region, which is divided into two provinces, Papua and West Papua.

            National Police Chief Listyo Sigit Prabowo said soldiers and police were deployed to locate and rescue the pilot.

            New Zealand Prime Minister Chris Hipkins said Wednesday that his country's embassy in Jakarta was leading its response to the hostage taking.

            “Consular support is being provided to the family,” Hipkins said. “You’ll be familiar with the fact that in these kinds of cases, we keep our public comments to a bare minimum.”

            Hipkins was referring to a policy of avoiding any discussion that could further endanger hostages or detainees during diplomatic efforts to secure their release.

            The 15 construction workers rescued by the security forces on Wednesday came from other Indonesian islands to build the health center in Paro. They had taken refuge in a priest’s house in the village since Saturday after a group of armed rebels threatened to kill them, regional military commander Brig. Gen. Juinta Omboh Sembiring said. 

            Sembiring said the workers were taken by helicopter to a hospital for a health examination.

            Separatists consider civilian workers to be outsiders and sometimes spies for the Indonesian government.

            Conflict in the region has spiked in the past year, with dozens of rebels, security forces and civilians killed.

            Last July, gunmen believed to be separatist rebels killed 10 traders who came from other Indonesian islands and an indigenous Papuan. Sambom later claimed rebel responsibility for the killing, accusing the victims of being spies for the government.

            Last March, rebel gunmen killed eight technicians repairing a remote telecommunications tower. In December 2018, at least 31 construction workers and a soldier were killed in one of the worst attacks in the province.

            Flying is the only practical way of accessing many areas in the mountainous easternmost provinces of Papua and West Papua.

Former Hsinchu City Mayor Lin Chih-chien (林智堅) withdrew from the race for mayor of Taoyuan City after National Taiwan University (NTU) confirmed his master’s thesis had plagiarism issues, though he continued to claim innocence.The DPP approved a motion Wednesday requesting its candidates for public office to sign a document confirming they had not indulged in any form of plagiarism, while a special team of experts and academics would investigate relevant accusations. If questions about the authenticity of theses persisted, the DPP would ask the candidates not to list the related diploma on their election registration form, the Liberty Times reported.The accusations against Lin were widely seen as one of the factors in the DPP’s poor showing in the Nov. 26 elections. Even though Lin was replaced by another candidate in Taoyuan City, the party still lost the seat of mayor to the opposition Kuomintang (KMT).When Lai took over as DPP chairman last month, he promised a package of reforms to improve the party’s image. The DPP leader, who also serves as vice president, is widely tipped as the frontrunner for the ruling party’s nomination in the next presidential election, expected in Jan. 2024, with legislative elections taking place on the same day.",2023/2/8,811,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804274,Farmers drive tractors to Paris to protest pesticide ban,"PARIS (AP) — Hundreds of farmers drove their tractors through Paris on Wednesday to amplify their demand to be allowed to use banned pesticides on sugar beets and other crops to ensure “food sovereignty” for France. 

            Entering the French capital through a southern gateway, the farmers' convoy rolled to the gold-domed Invalides monument, site of Napoleon’s tomb.

            The farmers were protesting what the national farming union FNSEA claims will be the disappearance of French farmers who are competing with cheaper imported products and facing multiple other challenges. 











            The French government decided last month to ban the use of neonicotinoids, which are chemicals used to killing infects that eat plants, following a decision by the European Court of Justice to end a dispensation granted for the class of insecticides. Farmers notably fear for their sugar beet crops. 

            The European Union's executive commission wants to ensure that at least 25% of agricultural land across the 27-nation bloc is reserved for organic farming, compared to 8% in 2020. 

            “At this rate, French agriculture will disappear,” France 3, a regional television station, quoted Damien Greffin, FNSEA president for the Paris region, as saying. 

            Greffin noted that Napoleon’s tomb, with a large field stretching before it, was not just a practical site for tractors to gather.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804275,English club sorry for making a signing that caused backlash,"MANCHESTER, England (AP) — A team from the seventh tier of English soccer apologized Wednesday for signing a player who was ruled in 2017 to have raped a woman, saying it had made a “significant misstep.”

            Manchester-based Radcliffe made no announcement of the signing of former Scotland striker David Goodwillie and selected him a game in the Northern Premier League on Tuesday without listing his name in the starting lineup on Twitter.

            There was an angry response on social media once it was discovered that the 33-year-old Goodwillie was on the official team sheet and the player, who scored a hat trick in the game, has since left the club, Radcliffe said.











            Goodwillie and an ex-teammate at Dundee United, David Robertson, were ordered to pay damages of 100,000 pounds (then $135,000) to a woman they raped, a judge ruled in a civil case in an Edinburgh court in 2017. No criminal charges were brought against either Goodwillie or Robertson.

            “As a club, we have always been about second chances and have been a part of many players’ and staff members’ rehabilitation along that journey,” Radcliffe said in a statement. “We’ve always given people a chance to improve their life and found support in this endeavor.

            “When the club were presented with David Goodwillie that same logic was applied, but in this case it’s clear that was a significant misstep and our due diligence should have been of a much higher standard.”

            The club said Goodwillie was signed “out of the desire to do a good thing for an individual with an admittedly tainted past as we have done so successfully before.”

            “But this was a bridge too far,” Radcliffe said.

            
                Scottish club Raith Rovers sparked an outcry among its fans and lost sponsors after signing Goodwillie last year.

            Within three days, Raith apologized for its decision and said Goodwillie would no longer be playing for the club.

            Amid Radcliffe's apology, the club said “this is a mistake that will never happen again.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804288,Edmunds: Car shopping trends and tips for 2023,"Shopping for a new or used car over the last few years has become a frustrating and expensive undertaking. Car shoppers have had to deal with vehicle shortages, high prices, dwindling incentives and rising interest rates. Will 2023 bring any relief? Yes and no.

            “Many buyers exited the market due to inventory issues or pricing that was not what they were expecting,” said Ivan Drury, Edmunds’ senior manager of insights. “While some of those issues will subside for 2023, current buyers will face a new set of challenges. The cost of financing continues to climb, which can offset some of the discounts from the manufacturer’s suggested retail price.”

            The experts at Edmunds have gathered five important issues you need to know about the current car-buying climate, plus tips on how to make the best of them. 











            INTEREST RATES ARE HIGH AND STILL RISING

            According to Edmunds data, the average annual percentage rate, or APR, on new financed vehicles climbed to 6.5% in the fourth quarter of 2022, up from 4.1% in Q4 2021. For used cars, the average APR climbed to 10% in the same timeframe, up from 7.4% in 2021. Experts are predicting that the Federal Reserve might have a couple more rate hikes in store for this year, so this situation isn’t likely to improve in the coming months.

            Tip: Get preapproved for an auto loan with your local bank or credit union. A preapproval allows you to compare rates offered by a dealership. Lower APRs can be found through the automaker’s finance arms, though the loan may have a shorter term than expected. And while it might be tempting to take a longer loan term to drop the monthly payment, keep in mind that you’ll be paying more for the car over time due to the added interest charges.

            INVENTORY IS IMPROVING BUT STILL BELOW NORMAL

            While you’re likely to find more cars on the dealer lots this year, the inventory may not be as high as it once was. Some automakers are faring better than others, depending on their supply chain and tolerance for excess inventory. 

            Tip: While the selection on the lot might be better, you should still be prepared to act quickly if you spot a vehicle you like. Those who need a new car in a shorter time frame will need to be flexible on the brand, model colors and trim levels to maximize their options. 

            PRICES ARE FALLING, BUT DON’T EXPECT DEEP DISCOUNTS

            For most of 2022, the average transaction price of a new vehicle was $600-$700 over MSRP. Compare that to December of the same year, when the average transaction price dropped to about $293 below MSRP. “While I don’t expect pre-COVID type of discounts this year, we’re definitely seeing movement in favor of the customer,” said Drury. 

            Tip: Given the volatility of pricing, it is critical to know the market value of the vehicle to avoid overpaying. Get multiple price quotes for the vehicle you want and check what others are paying on sites such as Edmunds. 

            YOU’LL NEED TO PUT MORE MONEY DOWN

            The higher prices of new and used vehicles today have forced shoppers to put more money down to get a reasonable monthly payment. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the average down payment climbed to a record high of $6,780 for new vehicles and $3,921 for used, according to Edmunds. 

            Tip: The old “20 percent down” rule is getting harder to abide by for most people. If you’re making a down payment of less than 20%, consider getting gap insurance or new car replacement insurance from the dealership or an auto insurance company. In the event of an accident, this policy will cover the difference between the vehicle’s value and what you might owe on a loan. 

            TRADE-INS WILL BE LESS VALUABLE

            The sky-high trade-in values of the past year or so are coming back down to earth as more inventory becomes available. While this is good news for used-car shoppers, those who are counting on their current vehicle to serve as a trade-in might be disappointed. 

            Tip: If your vehicle has lost value from the last time you checked it, you may have to make a larger down payment on your next purchase to get your monthly payments to fit your budget. Keep in mind that if you owe more money on a loan than the car is worth, it’s best to hold off on a purchase. Don’t risk rolling that amount into the next loan and repeating the same situation.

            EDMUNDS SAYS: Shopping for a car in 2023 may seem daunting. But you can make it easier by getting preapproved on your loan and researching a fair price for the vehicle you’re buying and the value of your trade-in.

Some automakers are faring better than others, depending on their supply chain and tolerance for excess inventory.Tip: While the selection on the lot might be better, you should still be prepared to act quickly if you spot a vehicle you like. Those who need a new car in a shorter time frame will need to be flexible on the brand, model colors and trim levels to maximize their options.PRICES ARE FALLING, BUT DON’T EXPECT DEEP DISCOUNTSFor most of 2022, the average transaction price of a new vehicle was $600-$700 over MSRP. Compare that to December of the same year, when the average transaction price dropped to about $293 below MSRP. “While I don’t expect pre-COVID type of discounts this year, we’re definitely seeing movement in favor of the customer,” said Drury.Tip: Given the volatility of pricing, it is critical to know the market value of the vehicle to avoid overpaying. Get multiple price quotes for the vehicle you want and check what others are paying on sites such as Edmunds.YOU’LL NEED TO PUT MORE MONEY DOWNThe higher prices of new and used vehicles today have forced shoppers to put more money down to get a reasonable monthly payment. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the average down payment climbed to a record high of $6,780 for new vehicles and $3,921 for used, according to Edmunds.Tip: The old “20 percent down” rule is getting harder to abide by for most people. If you’re making a down payment of less than 20%, consider getting gap insurance or new car replacement insurance from the dealership or an auto insurance company. In the event of an accident, this policy will cover the difference between the vehicle’s value and what you might owe on a loan.TRADE-INS WILL BE LESS VALUABLEThe sky-high trade-in values of the past year or so are coming back down to earth as more inventory becomes available. While this is good news for used-car shoppers, those who are counting on their current vehicle to serve as a trade-in might be disappointed.Tip: If your vehicle has lost value from the last time you checked it, you may have to make a larger down payment on your next purchase to get your monthly payments to fit your budget. Keep in mind that if you owe more money on a loan than the car is worth, it’s best to hold off on a purchase. Don’t risk rolling that amount into the next loan and repeating the same situation.EDMUNDS SAYS: Shopping for a car in 2023 may seem daunting. But you can make it easier by getting preapproved on your loan and researching a fair price for the vehicle you’re buying and the value of your trade-in._______This story was provided to The Associated Press by the automotive website Edmunds.Ronald Montoya is a contributor at Edmunds.",2023/2/8,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804290,"US, states weigh farmland restrictions after Chinese balloon","HARLOWTON, Mont. (AP) — Near the banks of Montana's Musselshell River, cattle rancher Michael Miller saw a large, white orb above the town of Harlowton last week, a day before U.S. officials revealed they were tracking a suspected Chinese spy balloon over the state. The balloon caused a stir in the 900-person town surrounded by cattle ranches, wind farms and scattered nuclear missile silos behind chain link fences.

            Miller worries about China as a rising threat to the U.S., but questioned how much intelligence could be gained from a balloon. China’s bigger threat, he said, is to the U.S. economy. Like many throughout the country, Miller wonders if stricter laws are needed to bar farmland sales to foreign nationals so power over agriculture and the food supply doesn't end up in the wrong hands.

            “It’s best not to have a foreign entity buying up land, especially one that’s not really friendly to us,” Miller said. “They are just going to take us over economically, instead of military-wise.”











            Miller's concerns are increasingly shared by U.S. lawmakers after the Chinese balloon's voyage over American skies inflamed tensions between Washington and Beijing.

            In Congress and statehouses, the balloon's journey added traction to decades-old concerns about foreign land ownership. U.S. Sen. Jon Tester, a Democrat, is sponsoring legislation to include agriculture as a factor in national security decisions allowing foreign real estate investments.

            ""The bottom line is we don’t want folks from China owning our farmland. It goes against food security and it goes against national security,” Tester told The Associated Press.

            At least 11 state legislatures also are considering measures to address the concern. That includes Montana and North Dakota, where the U.S. Air Force recently warned that a $700 million corn mill proposed near a military base by the American subsidiary of a Chinese company would risk national security.

            City council members in Grand Forks, North Dakota, endured a barrage of criticism from town residents Monday night before voting 5-0 to abandon the plan. The move came a year after a joint press release from local officials and North Dakota's governor called the project “extraordinary,"" saying it would bring jobs and bolster the farm industry.

            Enraged residents of the 59,000-person city near the Minnesota border demanded resignations from council members they claimed had tried to push through the plan, brushing off Chinese threats to national security.

            “You decided, for whatever reason, this was such a fantastic thing for our city that you got blinders on,” said Dexter Perkins, a University of North Dakota geology professor. “You guys went all in when there were a gazillion unanswered questions.”

            Before the Air Force’s warning, officials said they weren’t in a position to opine on national security matters.

            Foreign entities and individuals control less than 3% of U.S. farmland, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Of that, those with ties to China control less than 1%, or roughly 600 square miles (340 square kilometers). 

            Yet in recent years, transactions of agricultural and non-agricultural land have attracted scrutiny, particularly in states with a large U.S. military presence.

            Limitations on foreign individuals or entities owning farmland vary widely throughout the U.S. Most states allow it, while 14 have restrictions. No states have a total prohibition. Of the five states where the federal agriculture department says entities with ties to China own the most farmland, four don't limit foreign ownership: North Carolina, Virginia, Texas and Utah.

            The fifth, Missouri, has a cap on foreign land ownership that state lawmakers want to make more stringent.

            Ownership restriction supporters often speculate about foreign buyers’ motives and whether people with ties to adversaries such as China intend to use land for spying or exerting control over the U.S. food supply.

            Texas in 2021 banned infrastructure deals with individuals tied to hostile governments, including China. The policy came after a Chinese army veteran and real estate tycoon purchased a wind farm in a border town near a U.S. Air Force base. This year, Texas Republicans want to expand that with a ban against land purchases by individuals and entities from hostile countries including China. 

            Critics see it as anti-foreigner hysteria, with Texas' Asian American community particularly concerned about the effect on immigrants who want to buy homes and build businesses.

            In Utah, concern has centered on a Chinese company’s purchase of a speedway near an army depot in 2015 and Chinese-owned farms exporting alfalfa and hay from drought-stricken parts of the state.

            Lawmakers this year are considering two proposals that would, to varying degrees, ban entities with ties to foreign governments from owning land.

            “Do we really want any foreign country coming in and buying our agricultural land, our forests or our mineral rights?"" asked Republican state Rep. Kay Christofferson, who is sponsoring one of the bills. “If it would interfere with our sovereignty — especially in an emergency situation or during a threat to national security — I think that we’d lose our ability as a state to be independent and self sufficient.”

            Caitlin Welsh, director of the Global Food Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the scramble to limit foreign land ownership tracked rising U.S.-China tensions. Welsh shares concerns about U.S. adversaries purchasing land near military bases like in Grand Forks, but said worries about China controlling the food supply were overblown.

            “China is just a small slice of the bigger picture of foreign ownership,” Welsh said. “When it comes to food security, the biggest threat is that foreign owners can potentially pay a higher price for agricultural land, which then drives up prices.”

            The restrictions have encountered resistance in states with strong property rights. In Wyoming, two proposals to restrict foreign land ownership failed this week even though Republicans who control the statehouse were sympathetic to concerns about China expanding its reach.

            “We’ve had a lot of problems with China lately in the air. Big balloons flying over us. We look at this as a national and state security bill, for Wyoming and the United States,” said Rep. Bill Allemand, a Republican from Casper.

            Lawmakers on Monday rejected Allemand's proposal to ban ownership of more than an acre of land by people from China, Russia and countries the U.S. government considers state sponsors of terrorism. Skeptics said it would be difficult to police due to the complex web of title companies and holding corporations in agricultural real estate.

            “This is very easy to get around,” Republican Rep. Martha Lawley said. “We may end the day feeling good about ourselves, but we’ve opened up to a lot of liability.”

            Questions about foreign investment are increasingly prompting debate over whether cities and states should be rolling out welcome mats or shutting doors to potential threats. The issue can pit local officials interested in economic development against state and federal agencies concerned with national security.

            That was initially the case with the proposed corn mill in Grand Forks, where officials last year lauded the plans. But days after the U.S. Air Force shot down the Chinese balloon, which China insists was only a weather balloon, the sentiment had fizzled and the city changed course. 

            “There's something that I've learned through this process, and that is sometimes to slow down and make sure we fully understand before we move to the next level,” Grand Forks council member Ken Vein said before voting to abandon the corn mill.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804291,Russia seeks lengthy prison term for ex-governor,"MOSCOW (AP) — Russian authorities on Wednesday requested a lengthy prison term for a former regional governor who is standing trial on murder charges and whose arrest two years ago prompted weeks-long mass protests. 

            The prosecutor has asked a court in the Moscow region to sentence Sergei Furgal, former governor of Russia's far eastern Khabarovsk region, to 23 years in prison on charges of murder, attempted murder and illegal arms trafficking. Earlier this month, a jury panel found Furgal guilty on all counts. 

            Furgal, a former businessman, was arrested in July 2020 on suspicion of involvement in murders and taken to jail in Moscow. He denied the charges, which his supporters said were a vendetta by his rivals.











            After his arrest, thousands of demonstrators have regularly rallied in Khabarovsk, a city of 600,000 people near the border with China, with attendance peaking on weekends. They protested Furgal’s jailing and demanded that his trial is held in the city.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804293,Bassino edges Shiffrin as Italy goes 2-for-2 at ski worlds,"MERIBEL, France (AP) — Two days after Federica Brignone won the gold medal in the combined to open the skiing world championships, Italian teammate Marta Bassino added another in the super-G by edging Mikaela Shiffrin.

            And Sofia Goggia will be a favorite for yet another Italian victory in Saturday’s downhill, with Elena Curtoni a strong contender, too.

            Italy sure is looking good so far, even before Bassino tries to defend her title in the parallel race and she and Brignone go for gold in the giant slalom.











            “Federica had a great performance. It was something that inspired me a lot, because a lot of times she inspires me. The attitude to attack the slope and push every turn,” Bassino said. “I was thinking, ‘We are teammates, we work together, I can do the same thing.’”

            Shiffrin had to settle for silver in the super-G on Wednesday, two days after she didn't finish the second leg of the combined. Goggia finished 11th.

            “Great, now the pressure is on me,” Goggia said. “First Fede, then Marta and, and, and let’s see.”

            Later Wednesday, the Italian team went into mourning after Elena Fanchini, whose career was cut short by a tumor, died at 37.

            Goggia dedicated her downhill win in Cortina d’Ampezzo, Italy, last month to Fanchini.

            Fanchini last raced in December 2017. She was cleared to return to train nearly a year later but never made it fully back and her condition grew worse in recent months.

            Fanchini won a silver medal in downhill at the 2005 world championships and also won two World Cup races in her career — both in downhill.

            Bassino earned her second gold medal at the world championships after sharing victory with Austrian skier Katharina Liensberger in the parallel event at her home worlds two years ago.

            She became the second Italian skier to win the women’s super-G world title. Isolde Kostner won back-to-back golds in the mid-1990s, while Deborah Compagnoni won the Olympic super-G title in Meribel at the 1992 Albertville Games.

            Bassino has yet to win a super-G on the World Cup circuit, but did finish third in two races in January.

            “I’m speechless. It’s my first win in super-G, and here at the world championships. It is something I have to realize,” Bassino said. “Today I just did a great last part because I lost a lot of time in the first part. I was really suffering watching all the other girls coming down. I’m really happy and confident in myself. It’s really a great result for me.”

            In the super-G portion of the combined, Bassino showed that she was at ease on the bumps of the Roc de Fer course. She went out of the race because of a mistake, but before that she had been among the fastest.

            “I had everything right in my head,"" Bassino said. ""I’m really happy. The gold in parallel two years ago was nice, but today it’s something extra, something bigger. It’s incredible. I’m really happy with myself and at the same time amazed that I did the race so well.”

            Shiffrin said she expected Bassino to do well after seeing her shortly before the race.

            “I could see her in the start, she looked in the right zone,” Shiffrin said. “I could see she has the flow and I (was) like: Now I have to focus on myself and stop looking at Marta.” 

            Shiffrin, who won super-G gold in 2019 and bronze two years ago, led Bassino by three-tenths of a second at the second split but couldn’t match the Italian’s pace in the last part of the course and finished second, 0.11 seconds behind.

            Cornelia Huetter of Austria and Kajsa Vickhoff Lie of Norway tied for third, 0.33 seconds behind, to share the bronze medal.

            “I'm so happy with my run, and emotional, because I don't really feel like I should be winning a medal in super-G right now. There are so many women so strong and so fast,” Shiffrin said. “There was one moment where I thought I lost everything but then I could keep it rolling until the finish.”

            The silver is Shiffrin’s 12th medal in 15 career world championship races, giving her outright second place on the all-time list for the most medals won by a woman at the worlds, trailing only German skier Christl Cranz, who won 15 in the 1930s.

            Shiffrin had been heading for a possible medal in the combined event on Monday before straddling the third-to-last gate in the slalom portion.

            “I felt like I learned from the combined that I have to be much more aggressive with my skiing and with my tactics,” said Shiffrin, who was sixth in Monday's super-G run. “Also, this hill is difficult and it deserves respect for the terrain. You have to push the limit but if you go over the limit, it’s even worse. So I was trying to be really strong, really aggressive and just also a little bit smart.”

            Shiffrin has 11 wins on the World Cup circuit this season to take her overall tally to 85 — breaking Lindsey Vonn’s women’s record of 82 and moving within one of the overall mark set by Ingemar Stenmark in the 1970s and 80s. 

            Many pre-race favorites, including defending and Olympic champion Lara Gut-Behrami and Swiss teammate Corinne Suter, led Bassino by several tenths of a second before losing substantial time in the technically demanding middle section of the course, which was partly shadowed.

            American racer Tricia Mangan skied through a gate and crashed, breaking her right ski, but she appeared to escape serious injury.

            Before the race, French air force aerobatics squad Patrouille de France performed a demonstration of formation changes and crossovers with eight jets.

            The men's super-G is scheduled for Thursday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804295,"How fresh tax credits, rebates can launch eco home updates","If you’ve been holding off on home improvements, a new law signed last year and now in effect as of Jan. 1, 2023, may provide a fresh incentive.

            The Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, includes tax credits and rebates for homeowners who make energy-saving updates to their homes. Credits for improvements like new solar panels, windows, doors and air conditioners are available now, while rebates for larger energy-efficient updates are expected to become available later this year or next year.

            Here’s what to know about these perks, plus tips to plan your projects.











            TAX CREDITS FOR SMALLER UPDATES

            The IRA includes tax credits for around-the-house eco-friendly updates. Eligible purchases include energy-efficient windows, doors, insulation, central air conditioners and home energy audits. An IRS fact sheet outlines eligible home improvements.

            Tax credits reduce your tax liability for the year, says Los Angeles-based certified public accountant Michael DiBernardo. For example, a $500 credit lowers your taxes owed by $500.

            The IRA allows homeowners a 30% tax credit for some energy-efficient updates, capped at $1,200 per year. There’s also a $2,000 credit for heat pumps, heat pump water heaters and biomass stoves.

            MAKE THE MOST OF IT: Combining projects — like new insulation and a heat pump — can get you up to $3,200, says Kara Saul Rinaldi, president and CEO of the energy and environmental strategy firm AnnDyl Policy Group and an advocate of policies that helped shape the IRA.

            Keep receipts for each eligible update and add them to your tax forms, Saul Rinaldi says.

            INCREASED CREDITS FOR SOLAR PANELS

            The IRA also increased the credit for solar installations. Homeowners can get a tax credit for 30% of the cost to buy and install solar panels — up from the previous 26%. And there’s no dollar limit. If you pay $15,000 to put solar panels on your house, you can claim a $4,500 tax credit.

            Any unused credit carries to future years, so if you don’t owe taxes this year, you can use it later.

            MAKE THE MOST OF IT: The tax credit will reduce the cost of going solar, but if your goal is to lower your utility bill, first determine when you’ll see savings. This often depends on how much you currently pay, says Duane Knickerbocker, owner of Brower Mechanical, a Sacramento -based company that helps homeowners optimize energy use.

            The average payback period for solar panels is six to nine years, according to the Center for Sustainable Energy, a policy and research firm.

            REBATES TO GENERATE BIG SAVINGS — EVENTUALLY

            The “difference makers” in the IRA are two new rebates, Knickerbocker says. One program offers up to $8,000 for lowering the home’s energy use and the other provides up to $14,000 for electrification updates like appliances and breaker box upgrades.

            Unlike the credits, the rebates are designed to be offered at the point of sale.

            Low- to moderate-income households — defined in the IRA as those with total annual incomes of less than 80% of their surrounding area’s median — are eligible for larger rebates than those with higher incomes.

            Even if you don’t usually owe taxes and can’t use the IRA credits, the rebates mean you can still get a discount on energy-efficient updates, Saul Rinaldi says.

            MAKE THE MOST OF IT: It’ll be months, at least, before homeowners can get the rebates.

            In the meantime, consider a home energy audit to determine which projects to start once the rebates are available. Then work the savings into home improvement plans for this year and next, Saul Rinaldi says.

            FINANCING ENERGY-EFFICIENT HOME UPDATES

            The cost of some home improvements could diminish the IRA tax incentives. Here are ways to supplement financing for your project.

            – OTHER ASSISTANCE. The North Carolina Clean Energy Technology Center manages a database of state and local incentives that includes resources like solar installation rebates and low-interest loan programs. 

            – 0% INTEREST CREDIT CARD. A 0% annual percentage rate, or APR, credit card may be just as good as cash if you pay it off during the no-interest period, says Travis Gatzemeier, a certified financial planner based outside of Fort Worth, Texas. Good or excellent credit is usually required to qualify.

            — HOME EQUITY. If you have equity, consider a home equity loan or line of credit to finance larger updates, like new solar panels. Rates are often lower than personal loans and credit cards, but your home is collateral for the loan.

            – PERSONAL LOANS. Unsecured personal loans are a fast way to cover home updates and repairs: Some lenders provide funds the same or next day after approval.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804318,"Microsoft's Activision deal hurts gamers, UK watchdog says","LONDON (AP) — Microsoft’s stalled $68.7 billion deal to buy video game company Activision Blizzard has hit a fresh hurdle in the United Kingdom, where the antitrust watchdog said Wednesday that it will stifle competition and hurt gamers. 

            Britain’s Competition and Markets Authority said its in-depth investigation found that the deal could strengthen Microsoft's position in the growing cloud gaming market, “harming U.K. gamers who cannot afford expensive consoles."" In cloud gaming, players stream games on mobile phones and handheld devices they already own. 

            The blockbuster deal also could hurt British gamers by “weakening the important rivalry” between Microsoft's Xbox console and Sony's rival PlayStation machines, the watchdog said in a provisional report. 











            The all-cash deal, which is set to be the largest in the history of the tech industry, is facing opposition from Sony and pushback from regulators in the U.S. and Europe because it would give Microsoft control of popular game franchises such as Call of Duty, World of Warcraft and Candy Crush.

            “Our job is to make sure that U.K. gamers are not caught in the crossfire of global deals that, over time, could damage competition and result in higher prices, fewer choices, or less innovation,"" Martin Coleman, chair of the independent expert panel that carried out the investigation, said in a press release. “We have provisionally found that this may be the case here.”

            Microsoft's deputy general counsel, Rima Alaily, said the company is “committed to offering effective and easily enforceable solutions that address the CMA’s concerns.” 

            Activision also said it hopes to “be able to help the CMA better understand our industry."" In an internal email to employees, CEO Bobby Kotick said Activision looks forward to continuing constructive talks with regulators in Britain and the European Union, where a separate investigation is underway.

            “We are also confident that the law — and the facts — are on our side,” he said.

            The U.K. antitrust investigation is now set to drag on for a few more months, dashing Microsoft's hopes that a speedy favorable outcome could help it resolve a lawsuit brought by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. 

            But the fact that the U.K. didn't move to prohibit the deal leaves an opening to Microsoft for further negotiation, said William Kovacic, a former FTC chairman

            ""The key thing in the decision is it invites further discussion about solutions,' said Kovacic, now a law professor at George Washington University.

            The British regulator said it will seek feedback, including possible options to address its competition concerns, from interested parties for its final report due April 26. 

            The FTC has sought to block the deal, arguing that the merger could violate antitrust laws by suppressing competitors to Xbox and its growing game subscription business. 

            Microsoft told the FTC’s administrative judge in January that it was working to resolve the U.K. investigation, as well as the EU probe, and hoped to bring back proposed remedies to U.S. regulators. But emboldened by President Joe Biden to take a tougher look at big mergers, the Democratic-led commission has shown little appetite for talks.

            “It helps the FTC enormously if another major competition authority in the world moves to ban the transaction and not accept a settlement,” Kovacic said.

            The Activision Blizzard deal is one of several regulatory hassles for Microsoft in Europe amid expanded scrutiny for Big Tech companies on both sides of the Atlantic over worries that they have become too dominant. 

            One of the deal's flashpoints is Activision's hit video game Call of Duty. Sony has raised concerns about losing access to what it calls a “must-have” game title, while Microsoft has promised to make it available on all platforms. 

            “Our commitment to grant long-term 100% equal access to  Call of Duty to Sony, Nintendo, Steam and others preserves the deal’s benefits to gamers and developers and increases competition in the market,"" Alaily said. 

            The U.K. watchdog said options to ease its concerns include blocking the deal, selling off part of Activision's business or a so-called behavioral remedy such as an agreement to make popular games like Call of Duty available on other platforms, which it said would be less effective. 

            It's not the first time the British watchdog has flexed its antitrust enforcement muscles over a Big Tech agreement. Last year, it blocked Facebook parent Meta's acquisition of GIF-sharing platform Giphy over competition concerns, forcing the social media company to unwind the deal.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804320,AP WAS THERE: Kareem passes Wilt for scoring record,"EDITORS — Kareem Abdul-Jabbar passed Wilt Chamberlain for the NBA's career scoring lead on April 5, 1984 during a game against the Utah Jazz in Las Vegas. The Associated Press, as part of its coverage of LeBron James' breaking Abdul-Jabbar's record, is looking back at Abdul-Jabbar's historic night. This game story by now-retired AP Sports Writer Tim Dahlberg was published in the Biloxi Sun Herald on April 6, 1984. The story is published as it appears in the newspaper.

            ___

            By TIM DAHLBERG











            AP Sports Writer

            LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) — Somehow, the sky hook seemed appropriate.

            A shot he patented and used literally thousands of times throughout his pro career, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar turned to it again Thursday night to set a new all-time National Basketball Association scoring record, breaking Wilt Chamberlain’s mark of 31,419 points.

            The Los Angeles Lakers great took a feed from Earvin “Magic” Johnson near the baseline, faked a pass, and turned to his left to hit a soft 10-footer over two Utah Jazz defenders with 8:53 left in the game. The Lakers won 129-115.

            His teammates hugged him as a sellout crowd roared its approval and Abdul-Jabbar had another place in the record books.

            “I’ve always enjoyed being a scorer, I can’t deny that,” Abdul-Jabbar said.

            The 22 points gave him 31,421 for a career that has spanned 15 seasons, first with the Milwaukee Bucks, then with the Lakers. But Abdul-Jabbar says he would like to be remembered more as being part of a key part of a series of successful team than as a great individual player.

            “That’s what the game is all about,” he said. “You see exceptional players that couldn’t take their teams anywhere. I’ve always enjoyed doing well as a team.”

            With his parents on hand as well as NBA Commissioner David Stern, Abdul-Jabbar started with a rush, scoring 12 points in the first quarter and adding four more in the second to pull within five points of the record.

            The sellout crowd of 18,359 screamed in unison every time he touched the ball in the second half, but he scored only two points in the third quarter and, with the Lakers well ahead, coach Pat Riley asked if he would like to sit down for the rest of the evening.

            “Pat asked if I wanted to be taken out,” Abdul-Jabbar said. “I told him no, I’d rather get it done.”

            And get it done he did.

            With 10:45 left in the game, Abdul-Jabbar took a feed from James Worthy and dunked to tie the record.

            Less than two minutes later, Johnson looked for the ball, waited for his teammate to get downcourt, then hit the great center on the right baseline. Abdul-Jabbar turned to his left, and guarded by two defenders, hit his record-breaking shot.

            “When I got the ball I waved everybody out,” said Johnson, who had made no secret of his desire to get an assist on the record-breaker. “The first time, (Bob) McAdoo threw it to him but he got triple-teamed and I said, ‘Yeah.’ He threw it back out and McAdoo missed. I said ‘Okay, now’s my chance. I’m going to make sure I give it to him.’”

            Abdul-Jabbar said the record-breaking shot was nothing special, but admitted he was glad to have the record behind him.

            “It was a big burden off my shoulders and a big burden off the team’s shoulders,” he said. “Our goal is to win a world championship, we can focus on that now.”

            Chamberlain was supposed to be at the game to congratulate Abdul-Jabbar on breaking his record, but the former 14-season pro did not show up at the arena.

            “I’m not disappointed,” Abdul-Jabbar said about Chamberlain’s failure to appear. “I have immense respect for him. I know for a fact that Wilt doesn’t appreciate the fact that for a lot of his career he was taken for granted.”

            Abdul-Jabbar said Chamberlain did things on the basketball court that will stand the test of time.

            “There’s no way I can eclipse him totally,” he said. “He proved his greatness a long time before I started playing basketball.”

            With just one more season left on his contract, Abdul-Jabbar, who will turn 37 later this month, may be in the twilight of his career but he is not showing it.

            A former rookie of the year and an NBA all-star 14 times, he is still averaging 21.2 points a game this season even with reduced playing time granted as a concession to his advancing age.

            The scoring crown is now his along with a host of previous records. Many consider him the game’s greatest player, but Abdul-Jabbar says that’s not for him to decide.

            “That’s debatable and I don’t want to get into debates. I know my name will be brought up. That satisfies me.”

            Byron Scott led Los Angeles with 24 points, followed by Johnson with 23, Abdul-Jabbar’s 22 and 20 by Worthy. John Drew canned 24 for Utah and Adrian Dantley had 23.EDITORS — Kareem Abdul-Jabbar passed Wilt Chamberlain for the NBA's career scoring lead on April 5, 1984 during a game against the Utah Jazz in Las Vegas. The Associated Press, as part of its coverage of LeBron James' breaking Abdul-Jabbar's record, is looking back at Abdul-Jabbar's historic night. This game story by now-retired AP Sports Writer Tim Dahlberg was published in the Biloxi Sun Herald on April 6, 1984. The story is published as it appears in the newspaper.___By TIM DAHLBERGAP Sports WriterLAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) — Somehow, the sky hook seemed appropriate.A shot he patented and used literally thousands of times throughout his pro career, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar turned to it again Thursday night to set a new all-time National Basketball Association scoring record, breaking Wilt Chamberlain’s mark of 31,419 points.The Los Angeles Lakers great took a feed from Earvin “Magic” Johnson near the baseline, faked a pass, and turned to his left to hit a soft 10-footer over two Utah Jazz defenders with 8:53 left in the game. The Lakers won 129-115.His teammates hugged him as a sellout crowd roared its approval and Abdul-Jabbar had another place in the record books.“I’ve always enjoyed being a scorer, I can’t deny that,” Abdul-Jabbar said.The 22 points gave him 31,421 for a career that has spanned 15 seasons, first with the Milwaukee Bucks, then with the Lakers. But Abdul-Jabbar says he would like to be remembered more as being part of a key part of a series of successful team than as a great individual player.“That’s what the game is all about,” he said. “You see exceptional players that couldn’t take their teams anywhere. I’ve always enjoyed doing well as a team.”With his parents on hand as well as NBA Commissioner David Stern, Abdul-Jabbar started with a rush, scoring 12 points in the first quarter and adding four more in the second to pull within five points of the record.The sellout crowd of 18,359 screamed in unison every time he touched the ball in the second half, but he scored only two points in the third quarter and, with the Lakers well ahead, coach Pat Riley asked if he would like to sit down for the rest of the evening.“Pat asked if I wanted to be taken out,” Abdul-Jabbar said. “I told him no, I’d rather get it done.”And get it done he did.With 10:45 left in the game, Abdul-Jabbar took a feed from James Worthy and dunked to tie the record.Less than two minutes later, Johnson looked for the ball, waited for his teammate to get downcourt, then hit the great center on the right baseline. Abdul-Jabbar turned to his left, and guarded by two defenders, hit his record-breaking shot.“When I got the ball I waved everybody out,” said Johnson, who had made no secret of his desire to get an assist on the record-breaker. “The first time, (Bob) McAdoo threw it to him but he got triple-teamed and I said, ‘Yeah.’ He threw it back out and McAdoo missed. I said ‘Okay, now’s my chance. I’m going to make sure I give it to him.’”Abdul-Jabbar said the record-breaking shot was nothing special, but admitted he was glad to have the record behind him.“It was a big burden off my shoulders and a big burden off the team’s shoulders,” he said. “Our goal is to win a world championship, we can focus on that now.”Chamberlain was supposed to be at the game to congratulate Abdul-Jabbar on breaking his record, but the former 14-season pro did not show up at the arena.“I’m not disappointed,” Abdul-Jabbar said about Chamberlain’s failure to appear. “I have immense respect for him.

Moeller-Maersk, said Wednesday that 2022 was its most profitable year in “the history of the company” but warned that a plunge in container volumes and freight rates would lead to a drop in earnings this year.

            Full-year revenue increased by 32%, to $81.5 billion from $61.8 billion in 2021. In the last three months of the year, revenue of $17.8 billion dropped from $18.5 billion in the same period in 2021.

            Profits before taxes for 2022 came in at $30.2 billion, up from $18.7 billion in 2021. In the fourth quarter, they landed at $5.3 billion, down from $6.3 billion in the fourth quarter a year earlier.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804323,Visitors can see famed Florence baptistry's mosaics up close,"FLORENCE, Italy (AP) — Visitors to one of Florence’s most iconic monuments — the Baptistry of San Giovanni, opposite the city’s Duomo — are getting a once-in-a-lifetime chance to see its ceiling mosaics up close thanks to an innovative approach to a planned restoration effort.

            Rather than limit the public’s access during the six-year cleaning of the vault, officials built a scaffolding platform for the art restorers that will also allow small numbers of visitors to see the ceiling mosaics at eye level.

            “We had to turn this occasion into an opportunity to make it even more accessible and usable by the public through special routes that would bring visitors into direct contact with the mosaics,” Samuele Caciagli, the architect in charge of the restoration site, said.











            In an interview with The Associated Press, Caciagli called the new scaffolding tour of the baptistry vault “a unique opportunity that is unlikely to be repeated in the coming decades.”

            The scaffolding platform sprouts like a mushroom from the floor of the baptistry and reaches a height of 32 meters (105 feet) from the ground. Visits are set to start Feb. 24 and must be reserved in advance.

            The octagonal-shaped baptistry is one of the most visible monuments of Florence. Its exterior features an alternating geometric pattern of white Carrara and green Prato marble and three great bronze doors depicting biblical scenes.

            Inside, however, are spectacular mosaic scenes of The Last Judgment and John the Baptist dating from the 13th century and created using some 10 million pieces of stone and glass over 1,000 square meters of dome and wall.

            The six-year restoration project is the first in over a century. It initially involves conducting studies on the current state of the mosaics to determine what needs to be done. The expected work includes addressing any water damage to the mortar , removing decades of grime and reaffixing the stones to prevent them from detaching.

            ""(This first phase) is a bit like the diagnosis of a patient: a whole series of diagnostic investigations are carried out to understand what pathologies of degradation are present on the mosaic material but also on the whole attachment package that holds this mosaic material to the structure behind it,"" Beatrice Agostini, who is in charge of the restoration work, said.

            The Baptistry of San Giovanni and its mosaics have undergone previous restorations over the centuries, many of them inefficient or even damaging to the structure. During one botched effort in 1819, an entire section of mosaics detached. Persistent water damage from roof leaks did not get resolved until 2014-2015.

            Roberto Nardi, director of the Archaeological Conservation Center, the private company managing the restoration, said the planned work wouldn't introduce any material that is foreign to the original types of stone and mortar used centuries ago.

            “It is a mix of science, technology, experience and tradition,"" he said. 

            The origins of the baptistry are something of a mystery. Some believe it was once a pagan temple, though the current structure dates from the 4th or 5th centuries.FLORENCE, Italy (AP) — Visitors to one of Florence’s most iconic monuments — the Baptistry of San Giovanni, opposite the city’s Duomo — are getting a once-in-a-lifetime chance to see its ceiling mosaics up close thanks to an innovative approach to a planned restoration effort.Rather than limit the public’s access during the six-year cleaning of the vault, officials built a scaffolding platform for the art restorers that will also allow small numbers of visitors to see the ceiling mosaics at eye level.“We had to turn this occasion into an opportunity to make it even more accessible and usable by the public through special routes that would bring visitors into direct contact with the mosaics,” Samuele Caciagli, the architect in charge of the restoration site, said.In an interview with The Associated Press, Caciagli called the new scaffolding tour of the baptistry vault “a unique opportunity that is unlikely to be repeated in the coming decades.”The scaffolding platform sprouts like a mushroom from the floor of the baptistry and reaches a height of 32 meters (105 feet) from the ground.

            The company’s Latvian drone production plant was established in 2009. Among other countries, Edge Autonomy’s facility in Marupe has delivered drones to Ukraine. In October, a U.S. Congressional delegation visited the facility.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804340,Belgian police seize $1.6 million in sex trafficking probe,"BRUSSELS (AP) — About 1.5 million euros ($1.6 million) in cash were seized during raids in Belgium targeting an alleged criminal organization suspected of sending Chinese women to Europe and forcing them into prostitution, the federal prosecutor’s office said Wednesday.

            In addition, investigators took hold of four tons of coins with an unspecified value, prosecutors said. Belgian police took control of several buildings during the raids in Antwerp, Charleroi, Louvain, Neufchâteau and Brussels, prosecutors said. 

            After a two-year investigation, some 300 police officers took part in Tuesday’s raids targeting human traffickers. The prosecutor's office described the operation as one Belgium's biggest targeting human traffickers in recent years.











            A total of 27 people were detained, including nine who appeared before a judge and charged with human trafficking and money laundering. Three suspects had Belgian nationality, and the rest were of Chinese origin.

            Police raided more than two dozen locations across Belgium, discovering 20 alleged victims, all of them from China. Searches also took place in Spain and Switzerland, where two people were detained, according to the prosecutor’s office.

            Prosecutors said Chinese sex workers are increasingly present in Belgium, particularly in the capital, Brussels. They said the criminal organization targeted in the raids allegedly recruited women in China and transferred them to Europe, where they were “sexually exploited” and forced to surrender most of their earnings.

            The alleged prostitution ring used online rental platforms, hotels or vacation homes and websites specializing in sex advertisements for appointment bookings, prosecutors said, adding that the victims were often moved from one place to another across the continent.

            Some of the victims were sheltered at a specialized reception center, prosecutors said.

They said the criminal organization targeted in the raids allegedly recruited women in China and transferred them to Europe, where they were “sexually exploited” and forced to surrender most of their earnings.The alleged prostitution ring used online rental platforms, hotels or vacation homes and websites specializing in sex advertisements for appointment bookings, prosecutors said, adding that the victims were often moved from one place to another across the continent.Some of the victims were sheltered at a specialized reception center, prosecutors said.The European Union’s judicial cooperation agency, Eurojust, and the bloc’s crime agency, Europol, took part in the investigation.",2023/2/8,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804361,Vietnam’s Agriculture: Farmer-centered and Sustainable Transformation,"WASHINGTON, D.C., US -  Media OutReach - 8 February 2023 - Vietnam's agriculture is transforming from quantity targets towards profit, environment and farmer income targets.       Ahmed Eiweida, Vietnam Sector Leader for Sustainable Development (World Bank).     For decades, Vietnam's agriculture followed the targets of production volume. This growth model has failed to take account of income returns to farmers and all other environmental costs. This leads to a dilemma that when Vietnam's agricultural production and export revenue increased to a certain extent, farmers' incomes decreased over time. The shift to an economic growth model that put farmers at the centre will help reverse this trend, improve farmers' incomes and restore ecosystems and the rural environment.   At COP26, Vietnam pledged that it will reduce net emissions to zero by 2050.   At COP26, the Prime Minister made a commitment that Vietnam will reduce net emissions to zero by 2050 and will reduce emissions by 30 per cent by 2030 compared to 2020's level. At COP27, Vietnam submitted an updated Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) which sets higher targets. For agriculture, the unconditional NDC target by 2030 increases from 6.8 million tons per NDC 2020 to 12.4 million tons per NDC 2022; the conditional NDC target increases from 32.6 million tons per NDC 2020 to 50.9 million tons per NDC 2022. This translates into financial needs of around US$2.1 billion and US$16.1 billion to meet conditional and unconditional targets, respectively.   Vietnam's agricultural export turnover in 2022 clearly demonstrates its strengths and comparative advantages in the global agricultural supply chain and its important role for the global food security. This result has been accompanied by strong support of international partners and efficient utilization of ODA projects.   Rice farming is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in Vietnam's agriculture sector, emitting about 49.6 million tons of CO2e annually. Moving to low-carbon rice production offers the highest potential for Vietnam to reduce GHG emissions, particularly methane.   The Vietnam Sustainable Agriculture Transformation Project (VNSAT), financed by the World Bank, has demonstrated that by adopting improved rice farming methods so-called 1 Must 5 Reduction (1 must: certified seeds; 5 reductions: number of sown seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, watering and post-harvest losses), it will not only help increase yield and net profits for farmers but also significantly reduce GHG emissions. At the time the VNSAT closed in June 2022, the project was able to reduce approximately 1.5 million tons of CO2e annually.   These successful experiences will be upscaled if the government expands further supports to improve infrastructure and large-scale agricultural extension services. If the improved farming methods be replicated in the remaining core rice areas in the Mekong Delta, it might help reduce over 9 million tons of CO2e annually. The implementation of the VNSAT Project in 7 years (from 2015 to 2022) is evaluated as the most successful model project ever in international cooperation in agriculture.   On this basis, the World Bank is supporting Vietnam to access global funds to finance 100 million USD from carbon payments for rice farming in the Mekong Delta and preparing the Low-carbon Agriculture Value Chain Development Project following VNSAT.   With the companionship of international partners, Vietnamese agriculture is gradually transforming its production model to meet green growth, demonstrating an increasingly important role in the international community for sustainable development, emission reduction, climate change adaptation and mitigation.   Mr. Nguyen Do Anh Tuan, Director of the Department of International Cooperation under the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development affirmed that ""Vietnam is a responsible member of the international community and wishes to develop its agriculture in a responsible, transparent and sustainable manner. We do hope that our international partners will strengthen the cooperation with Vietnam in developing green and sustainable agriculture and achieving global food security"".

Notes:

            According to Mr. Ahmed Eiweida, Vietnam Sector Leader for Sustainable Development (World Bank), the new growth model of Vietnam's agriculture promotes environmental sustainability, restoring ecosystems and puttting farmers, at the heart of the development, which is aligned with global best practices.   In addition, Vietnam has made great progress in agricultural policy reform followed by concrete actions. Government strategies, such as the Strategy for Sustainable Agriculture and Rural Development for the period of 2021-2030 with a Vision to 2050 and the Mekong Delta Regional Master Plan, accurately capture the main aspects of the new growth model of agricultural economy covering both production, income, export, employment, environment, and rural development.   Corresponding to this mindset shift, the World Bank has also adjusted its focus on development assistance towards climate resilience, livelihood diversification, and low-carbon agriculture. The World Bank is also coordinating with FAO and IRRI to assist MARD in developing a standardised Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) system for the rice subsector.The issuer is solely responsible for the content of this announcement.Notes:According to Mr. Ahmed Eiweida, Vietnam Sector Leader for Sustainable Development (World Bank), the new growth model of Vietnam's agriculture promotes environmental sustainability, restoring ecosystems and puttting farmers, at the heart of the development, which is aligned with global best practices.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804385,Super Bowl teams have good backup QB plans,"PHOENIX (AP) — If all goes according to plan Sunday, the only time football fans will see Kansas City's Chad Henne or Philadelphia's Gardner Minshew during the Super Bowl will be on the sideline, holding a clipboard, talking on a headset or offering encouragement to teammates.

            But this is the NFL. Sometimes — actually, lots of times — things don't go according to plan.

            That's why the backup quarterbacks for the Chiefs and Eagles could be some of the most important players on their team's roster heading into Sunday's showdown at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.











            “You put your ego aside,” Henne said. “Every time you walk into the room, even though you want to be the starter, you’ve got to understand your role. There’s only 32 starting quarterbacks in the league and they're pretty darn good.

            “If you can be the next guy in line, that’s pretty good, too.”

            In a lot of ways, it's been the year of the backup quarterback. A total of 68 QBs started at least one game during the regular season, an average of more than two per team and a record for a non-strike year. Thirteen teams needed three quarterbacks.

            Then there were the poor Arizona Cardinals, who cycled through four QBs in four weeks.

            The 37-year-old Henne has been in the NFL since 2008 and was a starter at various points earlier in his career with the Dolphins and Jaguars. He’s been the Chiefs backup for the past five seasons, starting just once since 2014.

            Henne has already proven his worth in this year’s playoffs. Kansas City starter Patrick Mahomes left the team’s AFC divisional round game against the Jaguars with an ankle injury in the second quarter and Henne entered, completing 5 of 7 passes during a 98-yard touchdown drive.

            Mahomes returned after halftime, but those seven points proved crucial. The Chiefs edged the Jags 27-20.

            “To come in a hostile game, backed up to your 2, go 98 yards — that just shows the type of competitor he is,” Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce said.

            It wasn't the first time Henne has saved a Kansas City season. In another divisional game two years ago, Mahomes was forced into the concussion protocol and Henne guided the Chiefs through the second half of a 22-17 win over the Browns.

            Henne joked that he wished Mahomes would give him more opportunities to shine, but even if he never touches the field in a meaningful fashion this Sunday, he'll be ready.

            “You just go about it like a regular week,” Henne said. “You prepare like you’re the starter. If you do that, you set yourself up for success on Sunday.”

            Minshew is in his fourth season in the NFL out of Washington State. The 26-year-old first gained fame for his signature mustache while leading the Jacksonville Jaguars to some surprising wins in 2019.

            He’s been the Eagles’ backup for the past two seasons.

            Minshew started two games late this season when starter Jalen Hurts was dealing with a throwing shoulder injury. The Eagles lost both contests, but Minshew was productive, throwing for 355 yards against the Cowboys and 274 yards against the Saints.

            ""He's played a lot of good football and you want that experience that he has,” Eagles coach Nick Sirianni said. “He's given us some good minutes, some good time. He got to start two games this year and played really well in the Dallas game.”

            Sirianni said Minshew's resume with the Jaguars was a big reason the team pursued him a few years ago. He was 6-6 as a starter during that 2019 season, throwing for 21 touchdowns and six interceptions.

            “That's why we wanted him here with us,"" the coach said. ""We know how valuable he can be.”

            Andrzej Poczobut, 49, was found guilty of harming Belarus’ national security and “inciting discord” in a closed trial held in the western city of Grodno. Poczobut, a journalist for the influential Polish newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza and a top figure in the Union of Poles in Belarus, has been behind bars since his detention in March 2021.

            He reported extensively on the mass protests that gripped Belarus for weeks in 2020 following a presidential election that gave Lukashenko, in power since 1994, a new term in office, but that was widely regarded by the opposition and Western countries as fraudulent.











            The indictment against Poczobut referenced his coverage of the protests, along with his statements in defense of ethnic Poles in Belarus and reference to the 1939 Soviet invasion of Poland as an act of “aggression,” as evidence that he was guilty of the charges.

            Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki in a Tweet Wednesday condemned the “inhumane decision by the Belarusian regime” and vowed to “do everything to help the Polish journalist bravely fighting for the truth.”

            Poland’s foreign ministry summoned the top Belarusian diplomat in Warsaw, Alexander Tshasnouskyy, to protest the verdict. 

            Poland demands the release of Poczobut and of all political prisoners in Belarus and urges Minsk to respect international laws and put an end to actions against the Polish minority, the ministry said in a statement.

            A ministry spokesman tweeted that Poczobut is “a Polish and Belarusian patriot.”

            While no independent journalists or Western diplomats were allowed in the courtroom Wednesday, official court photos showed Poczobut with dark circles under his eyes, and suggested that he has lost significant weight while in custody.

            The journalist stayed in Belarus through the massive crackdown the authorities launched in response to the protests, which saw over 35,000 people arrested, thousands beaten by police, and tens of thousands more fleeing abroad.

            According to prominent Belarusian rights group Viasna, Poczobut refused to sign a petition to be pardoned by Lukashenko following his arrest. Poczobut's relatives said he was forbidden family visits throughout his detention, and has been unable to receive letters from his 12-year-old son.

            Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya in a Twitter post Wednesday described the verdict against Poczobut as Lukashenko's ""personal revenge.”

            “Andrzej refused any deals with the unlawful regime. Now we must do everything possible to free him along with all other political hostages,” she wrote.

            Viasna, the rights group, has included Poczobut in its list of 1,449 political prisoners held by Minsk.

            The Belarusian Association of Journalists (BAJ) issued a statement Wednesday demanding Poczobut’s immediate release.

            “There is a crackdown on any dissent in Belarus, and the verdict against Poczobut confirms that the authorities do not intend to stop the (cycle) of repression,” BAJ leader Andrei Bastunets was cited as saying.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804389,"NFL's QB shuffle puts premium on offensive, defensive plans","Tennessee quarterbacks coach Pat O'Hara called six-year journeyman Joshua Dobbs hours after a loss on Christmas Eve, asking him to come to the team headquarters on Christmas Day.

            Though he had signed just four days earlier, the Titans decided to turn the offense over to Dobbs and coach Mike Vrabel insisted the game plan would remain the same.

            Well, it really didn't. It couldn't.











            Dobbs was just one of many quarterbacks thrown into the heat of battle due to a rash of injuries at the league's premier position, making devising a game plan even more challenging. Those offensive schemes are tailored around the projected starter with opponents plotting to derail those plans.

            Yet league-wide, injuries force continual changes. So coaches and coordinators on both sides of the ball have had to be even more flexible, adapting often at a moment’s notice.

            It's not lost on the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles heading into the Super Bowl on Sunday. 

            Back in December with a playoff berth slipping away, the Titans gambled their postseason streak on Dobbs, going with him over a rookie with three starts and with veteran Ryan Tannehill sidelined by an injury.

            The Titans joined a list of 13 franchises starting three quarterbacks, the most ever in the league’s second 17-game season.

            The teams squaring off for the Lombardi Trophy on Sunday didn't have those problems: Patrick Mahomes started every game this season for Kansas City, while Jalen Hurts rested his sore shoulder sitting out two games for the Eagles. 

            Dobbs had just a handful of practices and a couple of walkthroughs — half as the backup — since signing with Tennessee. A third-round pick, Malik Willis was protected in his first NFL start, throwing only once after halftime with Derrick Henry running for 219 yards in a win in Houston.

            Thanks to his experience from previous NFL stops, Dobbs helped the Titans use a game plan that resembled an actual passing offense. Dobbs was much more decisive, allowing him to throw quicker and he had nearly as many yards passing in his first start than Willis had combined in his three.

            “Him just being able to see on some of the quick throws or three-steppers, Josh was able to stand in the pocket, being able to deliver it in a timely matter,” Titans veteran receiver Robert Woods said of Dobbs.

            The starting quarterback gets most of the snaps with the first-team offense, limiting the backup to running the scout team and no chance to build chemistry with the starters. 

            That means the backup must do everything else to try to be ready if needed. That includes studying the game plan and watching both film and practice closely. Kliff Kingsbury was fired after Arizona went 4-13 using four quarterbacks once Kyler Murray tore his ACL. 

            Kingsbury said that's the job.

            “They have to get all the mental reps they can, all the walkthroughs they can and then go out there and try to perform at a high level,” Kingsbury said of backup QBs during the season before his firing.

            
                Miami made the playoffs despite also starting three different quarterbacks with Tua Tagovailoa, Teddy Bridgewater and rookie Skylar Thompson each starting at least two games during the regular season. 

            First-year coach Mike McDaniel and his coordinator drew up different game plans for Bridgewater and Thompson later in the season. 

            Playing AFC East rival Buffalo in the wild-card round also helped.

            ""That gives you a little liberty to have some variance in your plan for each particular quarterback, and then when you get concrete clarity, you have one direction for your entire team to kind of go by and that’s what you stick with,” McDaniel said before Miami's playoff loss to Buffalo. 

            Preparing for different quarterbacks means similar adjustments on defense. Jeffery Simmons, the Titans’ two-time Pro Bowl defensive lineman, said he needs to know if the potential quarterback stays in the pocket like Tampa Bay's Tom Brady or scrambles like Baltimore's Lamar Jackson.

            “My job is to win up front and then focus on the quarterback,” Simmons said.

            Defensive coaches and defenders pull film of the potential quarterbacks, even if it means going back to last season. They study the opponent's offensive scheme as well. 

            That's why the Bills looked at all three Dolphins quarterbacks. Buffalo defensive coordinator Leslie Frazier also made sure to focus on Miami's other offensive playmakers such as wide receivers Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle.

            “That definitely presents different challenges when you don’t know who the starting quarterback will be,” Frazier said before Buffalo's playoff opener. “But we do know who some of the other pieces are, and where they’ll line up at.""

            And with the odds of the starting quarterback not finishing the game, planning for the other playmakers was probably a team's best option.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804390,8 Croatians in Zambia face new charges of child trafficking,"LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) — Eight Croatians rearrested in Zambia will face new charges of child trafficking and are expected to appear in court on Thursday, a Zambian official announced.

            Earlier this week a court dropped child trafficking charges against the eight — four couples — and ordered them to leave the country within 48 hours. But when they tried to fly out of Zambia they were rearrested.

            The eight were “detained pending prosecution on reconstituted charges but still related to attempted child trafficking,” Zambian immigration spokesman Namati Nshinka said in a statement.











            They are likely to appear in court again on Thursday, Nshinka said.

            They are charged with trafficking four children from Congo, aged between one and three years, said the statement.

            On Monday a court dismissed child trafficking charges against them following applications by their lawyers. They had earlier pleaded not guilty.

            The charges alleged that on December 7, last year, the four couples acted together to traffic the children. The Croatians said they adopted the children through a lawyer.

            The eight include Zoran Subosic, 52, a guitarist in a well-known band Hladno Pivo, or Cold Beer, and Immovic Subosic, 41, an administrator, according to Croatian media. Others include Damir Magic, 44, an electrical technician, Nadic Magic, 45, a technician, Ladislav Persic, 42, a medical doctor, Aleksandra Persic, 43, a hair salon attendant, Noah Kraljevic, 40, a program director and Ivona Kraljevic, 36, a dog handler.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804404,Will Russian support for Myanmar give Moscow an Asian foothold?,"As Myanmar this month marks two years since the country's democratically elected government was overthrown in a military coup, Russia remains a key supporter of Myanmar's ruling junta, both diplomatically and materially.Myanmar did not join in the international condemnation of Russia's invasion of Ukraine last February, and Moscow has consistently blocked UN Security Council resolutions condemning Myanmar's coup.Min Aung Hlaing, the leader of the Southeast Asian nation's military — called the Tatmadaw — is seeking domestic and international legitimacy. Hlaing has visited Russia three times since the coup.In September 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin met Hlaing on the sidelines of the Eastern Economic Forum.""Russia is not proactive, but rather reactive"" when it comes to its ties with Myanmar, said Alexey Kirichenko, assistant professor at the Moscow State University. ""This is a longstanding relationship that has been evolving for at least twenty years. It is not a desperate attempt to find a partner, but a situation in which both sides have something to offer to each other.""Russia does not have substantial investments in Myanmar and cannot compete with China economically. However, Moscow is a major supplier of arms to Myanmar's military.Russia supplies the junta with Pantsir-S1 surface-to-air missile systems, Orlan-10E surveillance drones, radar equipment, as well as M-17 and Mi-35 helicopters, Su-30 fighter jets, and anti-aircraft missile systems.The Moscow Times has reported that Russia sold Myanmar $14.7 million (€13.6 million) worth of radar equipment in February 2021 and $96 million worth of so-called ""hidden"" goods three months prior.Russian weapons are deployed in the junta's fight against bands of resistence fighters, with Mi-35 helicopters and Yak-130 combat training aircraft particularly valued for defending military outposts.The Tatmadaw is also seeking to modernize its forces with anti-drone systems that will likely be ordered from Russia. The money from these arms sales will also contribute to the Russian budget for the war in Ukraine.As Russia's military has waged war in Ukraine for almost a year, it is not clear how the situation will evolve.Importers of Russian arms have reasonable concerns that the contracts for arms supplies won't be fulfilled. According to a report by the Ukrainian military, Russia has already suspended a contract for supplying Ka-32 helicopters to Serbia and postponed another arms shipment to Algeria.In trying to sap Russia from sources of funding, the US and the EU have imposed a ban on the export of dual-use goods to Russia.These include, for instance, vehicle parts. Without them, Russia will find it hard to produce new arms for export. Last year, India already canceled a contract for the Ka-31 helicopter, MiG-29 fighter jets, and Mi-17 helicopters because Russia could not purchase high-tech production materials from European markets.""Russian arms play an important role in Myanmar's civil war. However, a temporary pause in Russia's deliveries will not directly influence it,"" said Michal Lubina from the Jagiellonian University in Poland.""Russia has already provided enough arms to the Burmese military, but they have not crushed their opponents yet and the question is whether they will. It is more about the will of the resistance,"" the political analyst added.China is the top supplier of weapons to Myanmar, but the complicated history between the two countries contributes to the lack of trust on both sides.Many generals now in Myanmar's junta remember fighting communist rebels funded by Beijing in the 1970s. Beijing also unofficially supports the Wa, Kokang, and Kachin ethnic armed groups fighting against the Tatmadaw.""The Burmese generals found themselves in a conundrum. On the one hand, it is a nationalist government that resents any foreign interference. On the other, they staged the coup and consequently isolated themselves into a corner where they have to depend on China. If they have good relations with Russia, they are not at the mercy of China,"" said Lubina.However, Beijing is aware that Myanmar's relations with Russia are not likely to affect Chinese interests.For Russia, there are limitations to a partnership with Myanmar. Trade is complicated by sanctions and difficulties with dollar payments. In the energy sector, Myanmar cannot afford to pay enough for Russian oil and gas to make it profitable for Russian companies.However, by providing support to the Tatmadaw, which is seeking to cement long-term rule in Myanmar, Russia could build on its limited presence in Southeast Asia. Currently, Moscow maintains close ties solely with Vietnam.""Should the junta succeed in the civil war, Russia will be the biggest winner because it was there for the military when they were in dire straits,” Lubina said.For Myanmar, Russia is a less-threatening partner compared to China. Russia's center of power is far away and does not pose a threat of invasion or internal meddling.""From the theoretical perspective, conflicts generally help Russia to acquire a bigger influence than its economic potential allows. In conflicts, a country can dispatch an army and use diplomacy, which Russia is good at. For Moscow, it is a cheap way of increasing Russia's importance in the world and overcoming isolation,"" Lubina said.Edited by: Wesley Rahn",2023/2/8,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804405,Migration: The European Union's perennial conundrum,"The 27 leaders of the European Union are due to convene in Brussels on Thursday and Friday for a summit dedicated in part to one of the political club's most intractable and ugliest fights: the question of how to handle migration and asylum.Unconfirmed leaks suggesting that Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelenskyy may be joining the gathering threaten to eclipse that focus. But with political sentiment increasingly hardened against new arrivals to Europe, you can still expect tough talk and strong soundbites this week.These days, a dwindling number of European governments are interested in opening their arms to people on the move, save to the notable exception of around 8 million Ukrainian refugees who have fled to Europe, of whom some 4 million are registered in the EU.Under far-right Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, Rome has tightened rules for humanitarian group-run boats that rescue migrants at sea, requiring them to return to port immediately after picking up migrants and not continuing to seek out other boats in distress.Conservative Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer is pushing for EU cash for border fences. Sweden, current holder of the rotating EU presidency, is keen to step up deportation. Poland and Hungary are long-standing, outspoken critics of liberal migration and asylum policy. Denmark has a goal of taking in ""zero"" refugees.Last year saw a drastic increase in the number of asylum applications in the EU. There were 924,000, according to the European Commission, up from 630,000 the year before.Applications are still well below the migration crisis peak of 1.3 million seen in 2015, when hundreds of thousands of Syrians and Afghans fled war for Europe. But the system is clearly strained. The Netherlands and Belgium are facing a reception crisis, with asylum- seekers even sleeping rough on the streets of Brussels in recent months.A European Commission proposal for overarching reforms to the migration system to see those seeking protection spread throughout the bloc has been on the table since late 2020, but negotiations have ground to a halt.Ahead of this week's summit, a group of eight member states spread geographically throughout the bloc wrote to top EU officials, warning it was ""high time"" for a European approach to deal with unauthorized migration. ""Irregular migration has once again become one of the most pressing issues in the EU,"" Austria, Denmark, Estonia, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta and Slovakia wrote in the letter seen by DW.Concretely, they called, among other things, for more tightly policed EU external borders (backed up by EU funds), stepping up deportations for those denied asylum and looking into more agreements like the one struck with Turkey in 2016 to take back rejected asylum-seekers in exchange for EU funds to host refugees.With no quick breakthrough expected on the larger reform package due, the European Commission has proposed more short-term measures: increased cooperation with third countries, and a push on deportations. Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a recent speech that most applicants were not eligible for protection, and that only 22% of those rejected were actually sent back to their country of origin.At this week's summit, EU leaders look set to support the use of both incentives and also new disincentives to get countries of origin to take back unsuccessful asylum applicants, instrumentalizing trade, development and visa policy — including potential restrictions to the latter — according to leaked draft conclusions seen by DW. 

German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser has spoken out against using threats to have partners cooperate.For anti-poverty campaign group Oxfam, none of the proposals floated in recent months are entirely new or a real solution. Oxfam migration expert Stephanie Pope told DW that they looked like diversion tactics.""From our perspective, it's basically all a load of noise and hot air that is distracting from the fact that after several years, the EU has still not managed to come up with rules to reform its broken asylum and migration system,"" she said.Using development aid is a ""fundamental misunderstanding of what development aid is for,"" she said. Similarly, ""suggestions to use preferential trade treatment or visa policies to try to basically bully non-EU countries into either taking back people who the EU deports or also stopping migratory movements towards the EU... it's essentially blackmail,"" Pope said.The first thing the EU could do start fixing its dysfunctional migration system would be ""finally coming up with a system where the responsibility for welcoming people who are seeking protection in the EU is fairly distributed among EU countries,"" Pope said.A recurring theme likely to be brought up by some leaders this week is the question of money from the EU budget being used to build walls or fences, a move typically resisted by the European Commission despite several member state requests. Austria's Nehammer recently called for €2 billion ($2.1 billion) in EU funds for the Turkish-Bulgarian border, one of the most strained points at present.

In an interview with several European news agencies last week, European Home Affairs Commissioner Ylva Johansson said she didn't believe that fences worked, but that physical infrastructure (e.g. for surveillance technology) could be covered from the EU budget.More than 1,800 kilometers (1,118 miles) of new border fences were erected on external and internal EU borders since 2014, according to a recent European Parliament report. Despite new construction, Frontex — the bloc's border control agency — said it had detected 330,000 illegal crossings last year, up 64% from the previous year.Catherine Woollard, director of the European Council on Refugees and Exiles, said there were serious problems with EU asylum systems, but warned politicians against manufacturing panic.""Those attempting to generate hysteria seem to be overlooking the biggest story of last year: that the EU was able to manage the displacement of 8 million people from Ukraine,"" Woollard wrote online last week. ""Why should 300,000 people crossing borders create panic when the arrivals of millions does not?""",2023/2/8,,

All 298 people on board MH17 died.Investigators in the Netherlands said there were ""strong indications"" based on intercepted phone calls that Putin had personally approved the weapons transfers to its proxy forces in the east of Ukraine.Russia has long denied any involvement despite a mounting body of evidence to the contrary.Despite the evidence, the probe is being halted as ""all leads have been exhausted"" and no further prosecutions could go forwardThe latest announcement comes weeks after a Dutch court convicted two Russians and a Ukrainian of mass murder for the loss of life aboard the flight.In a statement, the Joint Investigation Team of six nations probing the incident said, ""There are strong indications that the Russian president decided on supplying the Buk TELAR to the DPR (Donetsk People's Republic) separatists.""The Joint Investigation Team consists of investigators from the Netherlands, Australia, Belgium, Ukraine and Malaysia.Investigators also said Russian officials were said to have delayed a decision on whether or not to send weapons to its proxy forces in the east of Ukraine while Putin was at a D-Day commemoration in France in June of 2014.They played a recorded conversation of an aide who said, ""There is only one who makes a decision,"" later adding, ""the person who is currently at a summit in France,"" a reference to Putin.As head of state, however, Putin enjoys immunity, investigators noted. They also hedged and suggested that ""although we speak of strong indications, the high bar of complete and conclusive evidence is not reached.""Previously, investigators sought to name those responsible for firing the BUK missile that brought down MH17 and those whose responsibility extends to the chain of command. However, investigators conceded there were few avenues left to investigate the catastrophe.In 2019, investigators released phone calls showing contact between Russian proxy forces occupying part of eastern Ukraine and a Kremlin aide at the time, Vladislav Surkov.Dutch prosecutor Digna van Boetzelaer told a news conference, ""The investigation has now reached its limit, all leads have now been exhausted, the investigation is therefore being suspended.""The BUK missile that took out the Malaysian Airlines flight was brought from a Russian military base located in the city of Kursk.Victims of MH17 came from 10 countries, with 196 Dutch, 43 Malaysians and 38 Australian residents on board at the time of the missile strike.ar/jcg (AFP, AP, dpa, Reuters)",2023/2/8,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804407,Can the EU succeed on closing Indonesia trade deal?,"EU and Indonesian negotiators are meeting in Jakarta this week for their first in-person talks in almost three years over a trade agreement that aims to open market access and increase commerce between Europe and Indonesia.EU officials have expressed confidence that the 13th round of talks on the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) will show progress. Negotiations were launched in 2016, and sticking points include consistent complaints from Jakarta over European environmental legislation as well as reservations from both sides over the other's economic policy.After a meeting at the G20 Summit in Bali last November, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Indonesian President Joko Widodo set an objective of concluding the deal before the end of their mandates, which would require an in-principle agreement by the end of this year.A senior EU diplomat told DW on condition of anonymity that Brussels has high expectations of a breakthrough this week, almost seven years after negotiations first began. ""It is a critical test to assess the prospects for speeding up the negotiations,"" the diplomat said.Although the EU is ""committed"" to a positive outcome, ""achieving a deal ultimately depends on enhanced engagement by Indonesia, across all the negotiating areas,"" the diplomat added.The EU has already secured trade pacts with Singapore and Vietnam. Talks with Malaysia and the Philippines are on hold, although there is optimism they could soon be restarted. An EU fact-finding mission will soon head to Thailand to assess whether to kick-start negotiations.However, an economic pact between the EU and the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) remains elusive.For Indonesia, the main obstacle is the EU's deforestation initiative, which would ban imports into EU markets of goods linked to deforestation or forest degradation.Added to this, last November, the European Commission approved a measure to phase out palm oil-based biofuel by 2030, of which Indonesia and Malaysia are the world's largest producers.Both countries have taken the EU to the World Trade Organization (WTO) over its palm-oil measures, which they claim amounts to protectionism.They also claim the EU's deforestation regulation would destroy their small-scale agriculture industry, since most local businesses won't be able to comply with the vast paperwork and bureaucracy the regulation creates.In late January, Jakarta again sought WTO dispute consultations, this time regarding the EU's anti-dumping duties imposed on Indonesian stainless steel in late 2021.In the latest chapter of ongoing palm oil disputes, the Malaysian commodities minister and deputy prime minister, Fadillah Yusof, said at a recent industry event that an option would be to completely stop exporting palm oil to Europe ""if they keep making it difficult for us.""Malaysians are ""very serious about an EU embargo,"" said Bridget Welsh, an analyst at the University of Nottingham Malaysia's Asia Research Institute.The issue took priority when Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia's new prime minister, made his maiden visit to Indonesia in early January. It remains unclear whether Jakarta would cooperate with Malaysia on an embargo, although it would likely work in their favor.Palm oil though remains important to European energy production. In December, the European Commission said it thinks palm oil will still account for about a tenth of the EU's total biodiesel output by 2032, down from around 23% in 2021.Europe's clean energy transition, which is already facing complications due to the war in Ukraine, would be further imperiled if Malaysia and Indonesia imposed an immediate export embargo.Bernd Lange, an MEP and chair of the European Parliament's Committee on International Trade, told DW that he now sees ""more understanding in Indonesia for sustainable management of the palm oil sector and a more rational approach to export opportunities, so that this conflict is no longer an obstacle to further progress.""""But there is no question that EU policies, especially the unilateral legislation, need to be better communicated,"" said Lange, who also sits on the European Parliament's delegations for relations with Southeast Asia.""Trade partnerships can only really grow in partnership,"" he added.Nonetheless, there appears to be some frustration in Brussels that talks stalled amid the COVID-19 pandemic because Indonesian officials prefer face-to-face meetings.EU diplomats are apparently fed up with having to repeat that the EU's proposed deforestation regulation, while potentially impacting the trade pact, is a separate issue and was not designed to solely annoy Indonesia.There's also some disgruntlement about Indonesian regulation requiring all imported food to be halal certified by the end of 2024.Last November, the WTO upheld EU claims that Indonesia's export ban on nickel ore, a means of boosting domestic processing of nickel products, violates WTO rules.However, Jakarta hasn't budged, and Indonesian exports of nickel products were worth around €28 billion ($30 billion) last year, more than ten times what they were in 2013, according to data from the Economist.And President Widodo has stated that an export ban on bauxite ore, used to make aluminum, could follow in June, and bans on copper, tin and gold exports after that.The EU was also publicly critical after Indonesia's parliament refashioned the country's criminal code in early December, outlawing sex outside of marriage and imposing allegedly more restrictions on free speech.Widodo has been clear that he doesn't want to receive any lectures from Brussels. ""There must be no imposition of views,"" he said at an EU-ASEAN conference in December. ""There must not be one who dictates over the other and thinks that my standard is better than yours.""For the sake of a trade pact, Brussels might be able to swallow its usual desire to condemn what it considers infringements of human rights. After all, it already has a free-trade agreement with communist-run Vietnam, a one-party state with a chequered human rights record.Frederick Kliem, a research fellow and lecturer at the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore, reckons that both sides are somewhat justified in wagging a finger at the other.""The Indonesians say that the EU is shifting the goalpost during ongoing negotiations, with new legislation that affects the FTA potentially. They do have a point here,"" he told DW.The ""EU believes this to be mostly noise and not an insurmountable hurdle. And I agree with that,"" he added.Despite numerous sources of contention, analysts agree that both sides would benefit from cracking on with a trade deal.Indonesia is Southeast Asia's largest economy, but is not high on the list of regional trade partners. Bilateral trade in goods worth just €24.8 billion in 2021 was ""way below its potential,"" an EU diplomat said. It represents almost half of EU-Vietnam trade.Edited by: Wesley Rahn",2023/2/8,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804408,'Hogwarts Legacy': Harry Potter-themed game faces criticism,"Gamers, especially those who are also fans of the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, have been looking forward to this day for several years: the release of the long-awaited ""Hogwarts Legacy"" immersive, open-world role-playing game.Set in the late 1800s, it provides players with the virtual experience of attending a wizarding school, including riding brooms, mixing potions, and casting spells. It's the latest spin-off item in the franchise launched by the mega-selling ""Harry Potter"" books written by J. K. Rowling.But this release has been accompanied by controversy, primarily due to its indirect association with J. K. Rowling, who in recent years has made negative headlines by taking a stance that has set her against transgender rights activists.What started in 2018 with her ""liking"" a tweet describing trans women as nothing more than ""men in dresses,"" a move her team dismissed as a ""middle-aged moment"" caused by a slip of the thumb, has developed into the millionaire writer digging her heels hard into the anti-trans ideology, which she has expressed in tweets, blog posts, and her non-Harry Potter novels.Long lauded for her philanthropy, Rowling has meanwhile funded a women's center that specifically bars trans women.Most recently, the writer has railed against Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon for supporting a self-identification law that would make it easier for transgender people to change their gender markers.Against that backdrop, it seems inevitable that there have been calls for a boycott of ""Hogwarts Legacy,"" which have been hotly debated online.Rowling herself has called out one of those supporting a boycott, a trans gamer named Jessie Earl, accusing her of ""purethink"" and equating a boycott to burning books and libraries. (Though no definition of the term ""purethink"" can be found on the internet, Rowling is presumably referring to an intolerant ideology that would not allow any other opinion to exist.)The debate has become so heated that one gaming forum has banned any discussion of the game whatsoever.Yet there are those gamers, even within the trans community, who question the effectiveness of such a boycott, and assert that ""ethical consumption"" is impossible within the framework of global capitalism.Some have said they would try to buy the game second-hand, or even acquire a pirated copy. And still others have argued for separating the creator from their creation, and that the importance the Harry Potter Wizarding World has had for the childhoods of so many people lends it a meaning that has grown beyond what Rowling has intended.But can the publicly expressed views of this creator of a fantasy world be fully separated from the context of real-world harm being done to an already marginalized group?In the US, some state legislators are introducing ever more laws aimed at curtailing the rights of transgender people. And anti-trans sentiment in the UK has caused a political rift between Scotland and England. Trans people, especially trans women of color, continue to be the targets of often deadly violence.The games developer, Portkey Games, has been careful to point out that although ""Hogwarts Legacy"" is an officially licensed game, J. K. Rowling herself was not involved in developing the story in the game. Still, she will have received money from licensing her intellectual property to the developers.Portkey also appears to be further distancing itself from Rowling by adding the franchise's first transgender character, Sirona Ryan. The game also allows players to create a transgender character with the customization options.But it isn't just Rowling's controversial stance against transgender people that has sparked criticism of the game.The ""Harry Potter"" books and films have been accused of perpetuating antisemitic stereotypes with the characters of the goblins, who are portrayed as a secretive group of hook-nosed bankers.And in this game, one of the tasks is to battle those figures, who are staging a ""Goblin rebellion,"" in protest at their lack of rights, which includes their being banned from using their own magical skills.Portkey itself has come under fire during the creation of the game, with senior producer Troy Leavitt criticized for a YouTube channel featuring anti-feminist and misogynistic videos. That employee has since resigned.Any or all of those factors may well lead some gamers to choose not to buy ""Hogwarts Legacy.""But it's clear that the boycott efforts have failed. Even ahead of its launch, ""Hogwarts Legacy"" is already the best-selling game on several platforms.The Harry Potter Wizarding World remains hugely successful, and many people who grew up with it remain intensely emotionally connected to it — even if they also belong to marginalized groups who stand to suffer from anti-transgender views.Edited by: Elizabeth Grenier",2023/2/8,,

            The project to preserve 233 live radio broadcasts that were recorded on 256 one-quarter inch (0.63 centimeter) reel-to-reel analog tapes that were becoming increasingly fragile and in danger of chemical deterioration was funded by grants totaling $24,000 from the Grammy Museum and the Council on Library and Information Resource.

            The recordings chronicle Williams' work with guest performers from a broad spectrum of the entertainment industry: classical artists like Yo-Yo Ma and James Galway; popular stars such as Joan Baez and Ray Charles; Broadway stars like Carol Channing and Joel Grey; jazz musicians including Wynton Marsalis and Sarah Vaughan; and comedic talents such as Victor Borge.











            The concerts were originally broadcast locally before being distributed to radio stations nationwide. Some feature the first concert arrangements of many of the Oscar- and Grammy-winning Williams’ film scores.

            The BSO has completed the digitization process and is currently creating access files for public use.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804412,Rwandan driver fined after guilty plea for reporter's death,"KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) — A driver whose car hit and killed a Rwandan investigative journalist has pled guilty and has been fined by a court.

            Moise Emmanuel Bagirishya was fined $920 for involuntary manslaughter, three weeks after the crash which killed John William Ntwali.

            Ntwali was riding as a passenger on a motorbike when the accident happened on Jan. 18.











            He was investigating and exposing human rights violations in Rwanda and activists had called for investigations into his death.

            The motorist who pleaded guilty will also pay $500 for injuries to the motorcyclist who was carrying Ntwali.

            The prosecution during the trial had asked the court to jail the motorist for two years and fine him $1,800 after he pleaded guilty and asked for forgiveness.

            The law in Rwanda allows 30 days to appeal but Ntwali’s family has told local media they will not file an appeal.

            Dozens of African civil society groups and press associations on Tuesday called for an independent investigation into Ntwali’s death, saying the official explanation lacked sufficient evidence.

            “Rwandan authorities have failed to provide a police report, the exact location of the alleged accident, any photo or video evidence or detailed information on the others involved in the accident,” the statement said.

            Ntwali had previously expressed fears for his life and told the Human Rights Watch rights organization that he had received phone threats and strangers had visited his house.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804415,Danish queen to undergo 'major back surgery',"COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — Denmark’s Queen Margrethe II, whose half-century reign makes her Europe’s longest-serving monarch, will undergo “major back surgery” later this month, the royal palace said Wednesday.

             The 82-year-monarch will be hospitalized afterward and undergo “a longer rehabilitation process,” the royal household said in a statement.

            “During a long period, Her Majesty has been affected by problems with her back, and in recent times the situation has worsened,” the statement said.











            Margrethe has decided to undergo “major back surgery” on Feb. 22 after consulting with doctors, the palace said, adding that several official engagements will either be postponed, canceled or handled by other members of the royal family.

            The oldest son of Denmark’s popular monarch, heir to the throne Crown Prince Frederik, and his wife, Crown Princess Mary, are likely to step in as well as Margrethe’s youngest son, Prince Joachim and his wife Princess Marie, and the queen's sister, Princess Benedikte. 

            In the past several days, Margrethe had canceled events, including the opening of an exhibition in Copenhagen.

            The Danish Constitution gives Margrethe, Denmark's head of state, no political power and her duties are ceremonial. She was proclaimed queen on Jan. 15, 1972, a day after her father, King Frederik IX, died following a short illness.COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — Denmark’s Queen Margrethe II, whose half-century reign makes her Europe’s longest-serving monarch, will undergo “major back surgery” later this month, the royal palace said Wednesday.The 82-year-monarch will be hospitalized afterward and undergo “a longer rehabilitation process,” the royal household said in a statement.“During a long period, Her Majesty has been affected by problems with her back, and in recent times the situation has worsened,” the statement said.Margrethe has decided to undergo “major back surgery” on Feb. 22 after consulting with doctors, the palace said, adding that several official engagements will either be postponed, canceled or handled by other members of the royal family.The oldest son of Denmark’s popular monarch, heir to the throne Crown Prince Frederik, and his wife, Crown Princess Mary, are likely to step in as well as Margrethe’s youngest son, Prince Joachim and his wife Princess Marie, and the queen's sister, Princess Benedikte.In the past several days, Margrethe had canceled events, including the opening of an exhibition in Copenhagen.The Danish Constitution gives Margrethe, Denmark's head of state, no political power and her duties are ceremonial.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804434,Germany's Merkel receives UNESCO peace prize in Ivory Coast,"YAMOUSSOUKRO, Ivory Coast (AP) — Former German Chancellor Angela Merkel received a UNESCO peace prize Wednesday for her decision to welcome more than 1.2 million migrants to Germany despite resistance at home and among European partners.

            Organizers said that Merkel showed political courage when Germany welcomed refugees in 2015-2016 who had fled conflicts in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Eritrea.

            Nobel Peace Prize winner Denis Mukwege, president of the jury awarding the prize, praised Merkel for having opened the gates of Germany ”at the same time many other countries were overcome with fear.""











            “You showed public opinion and decision-makers that we have not only to defend our own rights, but those of others in times of crisis, that each society needs more than ever to respect and protect human rights without any form of discrimination,” he said. 

            “We commend your humanity, your spirit of solidarity and your keen sense of ethics and your inspiring leadership,” he added.

            In accepting the award, Merkel spoke of current refugee crises, particularly the war in Ukraine.

            “We had thought that the time of war in Europe had passed,"" Merkel said. ""But since the 24th of February of last year, which is when Russia’s vicious aggression on Ukraine took place, we have come to the sad conclusion that that’s not the case. This has shaken Europe to its roots.”

            The 68-year-old center-right politician, who led Germany for 16 years, has kept a relatively low profile since handing over to successor Olaf Scholz in December 2021. 

            Among a few other appearances, the one-time physicist accepted an award from the U.N. refugee agency and gave a speech honoring the former head of a national scientific academy in which she mentioned gut flora and antibiotic resistance. Her political memoirs are due to be published in 2024.

            The Félix Houphouët-Boigny Peace Prize awarded to Merkel on Wednesday is named for Ivory Coast's first president after independence from France in 1960. The award was presented to Merkel in Yamoussoukro, Ivory Coast's capital and the hometown of the late Houphouët-Boigny.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804445,"Analysis: LeBron has defied odds, with no drop-off in sight","LeBron James is 38 years old. He is in Season 20 of his NBA career. He is, by conventional basketball-playing standards, ancient.

            History says his decline should have started already.

            Except it hasn't. Not even close. And count that as just another example of what sets James apart from so many other greats, so many other superstars of their sport who were good enough for long enough to climb atop some lists in the record books.











            The NBA's new scoring leader — he caught Kareem Abdul-Jabbar on Tuesday night, one Los Angeles Lakers great taking the record from another — is still one of the very best in the game. He is talking about playing two more years, three more years, maybe more. He could raise the scoring-record bar so high by the time he retires that it would be, at best, highly unrealistic for anyone to catch him.

            “I know I’m still playing at a high level. ... I’ve been able to do some incredible things in this league,” James said after he scored 38 points on the record-setting night to lift his career total to 38,390 — three more than Abdul-Jabbar, whose reign atop the NBA scoring list ended after almost 39 years. “And hopefully I can do some more incredible things before I’m done.”

            The unfortunate part about most longevity records is this: Young athletes don't set them. By design, they're usually broken by athletes who are at or near the end of their career.

            Take Pete Rose, for example. Rose got his 4,192nd career hit — a record-breaker, the one where he passed Ty Cobb’s official total (some say Rose actually had the record a few hits earlier, but the recognized number for Cobb by Major League Baseball remains 4,191 hits) — on Sept. 11, 1985.

            At that moment, when Rose lined that hit off Eric Show, he was a .304 career hitter. But after the record-setter, he batted .225 for the remainder of his career. In fairness, he was 44 and 45 years old during that stint of batting .225.

            He slowed down. It happens to everyone. Well, almost everyone.

            “I think about the wear and tear on LeBron's body and the lack of sleep and the 3 1/2 games a week, season after season, how he takes care of himself,"" NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said. “I hope the young players pay attention to that. Anyone who’s ever been around LeBron, he’s always working on his body.""

            Tiger Woods got 79 wins in 295 PGA Tour starts between 1996 and 2013, a ridiculously high-for-golf 27% winning rate. Since then, after off-the-course issues and a slew of injuries, Woods has won three times in 62 starts. He has tied Sam Snead for the all-time wins record on tour with 82. No one would dare doubt that Woods can find a way to get one more win and claim the record outright, but few would also say that it should be considered likely.

            Wayne Gretzky caught Gordie Howe for the all-time NHL goals record and was still every bit The Great One — his moniker for decades now. But over his last five seasons after setting the record, Gretzky’s production predictably dipped a bit. He averaged 0.25 goals and 1.1 points per game over those last five seasons, at the ages of 34 through 38. Before that, he averaged 0.71 goals and 2.2 points per game.

            Even Abdul-Jabbar, after catching Wilt Chamberlain in 1984, saw his numbers decrease. Before the record, Abdul-Jabbar averaged 27.0 points. Afterward, 17.7 points.

            “Kareem was a great player his entire career, even after setting the record,"" said Pat Riley, his coach with the Lakers and now the president of the Miami Heat. “The record didn't change anything for him.""

            There are two notable exceptions to the notion that says player production almost always must drop off after setting records.

            James is the first one. Kobe Bryant averaged 17.6 points in his 20th season, a record for anyone who played that deep into their NBA career. It won’t be a record much longer. James is averaging 30 per game in his 20th season.

            The other exception is Tom Brady.

            The recently retired seven-time Super Bowl champion never slowed down after catching Drew Brees for three of the biggest records a quarterback can have — most completions, most touchdowns and most yards.

            Consider what Brady did this season, his 23rd, at 45 years old: 4,694 yards, 25 touchdown passes, a career-best and league-high 490 completions, a career-best and league-high 733 attempts. It might not have been his best year, but it was still incredibly prolific.

            “There's always going to be a part that wants to play and a part of me that feels like I can play,"" Brady said on his “Let's Go!"" podcast when explaining his retirement decision. “I think there's just a decision to know that it's the right time. I think for me, it's going to end at some point and now's the time.""

            Brady never dropped off. Ever.

            So far, we can say the same about James. He continues to defy Father Time.

            And now, sit back and watch how many more points he adds to this total. Barring injury, 40,000 points will happen. If he plays two or three more full seasons, 42,000 or 43,000 isn't unthinkable.

            “He's going to extend this record even further,"" Abdul-Jabbar told TNT after the game Tuesday night. “And it'll be interesting to see how far it goes.""

            AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsLeBron James is 38 years old. He is in Season 20 of his NBA career. He is, by conventional basketball-playing standards, ancient.History says his decline should have started already.Except it hasn't. Not even close. And count that as just another example of what sets James apart from so many other greats, so many other superstars of their sport who were good enough for long enough to climb atop some lists in the record books.The NBA's new scoring leader — he caught Kareem Abdul-Jabbar on Tuesday night, one Los Angeles Lakers great taking the record from another — is still one of the very best in the game. He is talking about playing two more years, three more years, maybe more. He could raise the scoring-record bar so high by the time he retires that it would be, at best, highly unrealistic for anyone to catch him.“I know I’m still playing at a high level. ... I’ve been able to do some incredible things in this league,” James said after he scored 38 points on the record-setting night to lift his career total to 38,390 — three more than Abdul-Jabbar, whose reign atop the NBA scoring list ended after almost 39 years. “And hopefully I can do some more incredible things before I’m done.”The unfortunate part about most longevity records is this: Young athletes don't set them.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804446,Brazil pushes illegal miners out of Yanomami territory,"ALTO ALEGRE, Brazil (AP) — Armed government officials with Brazil's justice, Indigenous and environment ministries pressed illegal gold miners out of Yanomami Indigenous territory Wednesday, citing widespread river contamination, famine and disease they have brought to one of the most isolated groups in the world.

            People involved in illegal gold dredging streamed away from the territory on foot. The operation could take months. There are believed to be some 20,000 people engaged in the activity, often using toxic mercury to separate the gold. An estimated 30,000 Yanomami people live in Brazil’s largest Indigenous territory, which covers an area roughly the size of Portugal and stretches across Roraima and Amazonas states in the northwest corner of Brazil’s Amazon. 

            The authorities — the Brazilian environmental agency Ibama, with support from the National Foundation of Indigenous Peoples and the National Guard — found an airplane, a bulldozer, and makeshift lodges and hangars, and destroyed them — as permitted by law. Two guns and three boats with 5,000 liters (1,320 gallons) of fuel were seized. They also discovered a helicopter hidden in the forest and set it ablaze. 











            Ibama established a checkpoint next to a Yanomami village on the Uraricoera River to interrupt the miners' supply chain there. Agents seized the 12-meter (39-foot) boats, loaded with a ton of food, freezers, generators, and internet antennas. The cargo will now supply the federal agents. No more boats carrying fuel and equipment will be allowed to proceed past the blockade.

            The large amount of supplies bound upriver could indicate some of the gold miners were ignoring President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s promise to expel them after years of neglect under his predecessor, Bolsonaro, who tried to legalize the activity.

            Other miners, however, sensed it was better to return to the city. On Tuesday, The Associated Press visited a makeshift port alongside the Uraricoera River, accessible only by three-hour drive on a dirt road. Dozens of gold miners arrived over the course of the day, some of them after walking for days through the forest, en route to state capital Boa Vista.

            One of them, João Batista Costa, 61, told reporters the Yanomami are dying of hunger and that recent emergency food shipments have not been enough.

            The federal government has declared a public health emergency for the Yanomami people, who are suffering from malnutrition and diseases such as malaria as a consequence of illegal mining.

            A report published yesterday by the Health Ministry found that gold miners have invaded four clinics inside Yanomami territory, leaving them inoperational. In the city of Boa Vista, where starving and sick Indigenous people have been medevaced to a temporary medical facility, there are 700 Yanomami, more than three times its capacity. 

            The gold miners, who come from poor regions, such as Maranhao state in Brazil's Northeast, usually cross the forest wearing flip-flops, carrying only food and personal belongings in their backpacks. They sleep in hammocks in campsites. 

            But their mining depends on sophisticated logistics to outfox authorities and is backed by investors outside the forest. Such tactics include: illicit fuel distribution on the outskirts of Indigenous land; airstrips carved from the jungle for transport of miners and supplies; light planes with modified tail numbers, registered to front companies; helicopters operating between mining sites on the reserves, and clandestine communication networks.

            “This operation hasn’t come a moment too soon,” Sarah Shenker, the head of the non-profit Survival International in Brazil, said in a statement. ""It’s absolutely vital that the authorities get the miners out, and keep them out. They’ve blighted the Yanomami’s lives for far too long, and have caused untold misery and destruction. Even if all of them are removed, and they can be kept out, it will take years for the Yanomami and their rainforest to recover.”

            Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska said police would be given additional staff, funding and resources to address online crime. He said reported cases of cybercrime were up 72% last year compared to 2019, and 352% compared to 2015.

            “The ... decline in conventional crime and the increase in cybercrime has brought us to a turning point: today, one in every five crimes in Spain is committed online,"" he told a press conference in Madrid.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804452,EU bishops demand release of clergy detained in Nicaragua,"ROME (AP) — European bishops on Wednesday demanded the immediate release of Nicaraguan clergy detained in the government’s crackdown on the Catholic Church, saying they have been falsely accused and are being subjected to unjust persecution.

            Cardinal Jean-Claude Hollerich, president of the Commission of the Bishops Conferences of the European Union, said European bishops would do “everything in their power” to press EU institutions to work to liberate the detainees.

            Hollerich’s letter to the head of the Nicaraguan bishops conference came a day after a Nicaraguan court sentenced four Catholic priests to 10 years in prison on conspiracy charges stemming from long-standing government allegations that the church backed illegal pro-democracy protests. A fifth priest was sentenced on the same charges Sunday.











            It was the latest chapter in a crackdown on the church by President Daniel Ortega.

            Hollerich’s letter came in sharp contrast to the relative silence from the Vatican, which did not respond Wednesday to requests for comment on the court sentences. The Holy See has kept relatively quiet about the Nicaraguan crackdown, believing that speaking out would only inflame tensions further.

            Pope Francis last spoke out publicly after Nicaraguan police raided the home of Matagalpa Bishop Rolando Álvarez in August. A few weeks later, during a press conference returning from Kazakhstan, he confirmed a dialogue was under way with the government, but has said nothing since.

            Alvarez had been a key religious voice in discussions of Nicaragua’s future since 2018, when a wave of protests against Ortega’s government led to a sweeping crackdown on opponents. Alvarez is under house arrest on charges of conspiracy and “damaging the Nicaraguan government and society,” and is set to be sentenced soon.

            In the letter, Hollerich said the government’s actions were violating religious freedom.

            “We are closely following the development of the situation in Nicaragua, marked by the persecution of the Catholic Church and its faithful,” he wrote. “We join the voices crying out over the injustice to which our brothers in Nicaragua are being subjected and demand their immediate release.”ROME (AP) — European bishops on Wednesday demanded the immediate release of Nicaraguan clergy detained in the government’s crackdown on the Catholic Church, saying they have been falsely accused and are being subjected to unjust persecution.Cardinal Jean-Claude Hollerich, president of the Commission of the Bishops Conferences of the European Union, said European bishops would do “everything in their power” to press EU institutions to work to liberate the detainees.Hollerich’s letter to the head of the Nicaraguan bishops conference came a day after a Nicaraguan court sentenced four Catholic priests to 10 years in prison on conspiracy charges stemming from long-standing government allegations that the church backed illegal pro-democracy protests.

            The court in Luxembourg decided that the European Commission does not have to accept the group as an interested party and is not obligated to open an investigation into its complaint of alleged unlawful state aid to PSG.

            The demand was presented in October by a fan group in Lyon that argued their rights as Barcelona members were being violated by clubs who had an unfair advantage because of allegedly inefficient financial fair play rules in places such as France.











            The group’s objective was similar to what the Spanish league has been trying to do to contain the free spending of state-owned clubs like PSG and United Arab Emirates-backed Manchester City. The league filed a complaint to UEFA against PSG for breaking financial fair play rules when it gave Kylian Mbappé a new deal that convinced him to reject a move to Real Madrid.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804455,Mexico expects US to finance 4 wind power plants,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico’s president said Wednesday that he expects the U.S. government or U.S. banks to provide interest-free loans to build four wind-power farms in the narrow waist of southern Mexico, an area known as the Isthmus of Tehuantepec.

            President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said he expects the U.S. to go there next month along with U.S. climate envoy John Kerry to launch the projects. 

            López Obrador also fueled speculation that U.S. automaker Tesla will build a plant in Mexico, saying that he had been told that Elon Musk's company was looking at either the northern border state of Nuevo Leon or the state of Hidalgo, just north of Mexico City.











            The wind farms on the isthmus are part of López Obrador’s plans to build a total of 10 industrial parks along a renovated rail corridor linking the Pacific and Gulf coasts, as part of an effort to create jobs in the poorer, less-developed south of Mexico.

            However, the construction of wind farms has faced past opposition from local residents in the area.

            And López Obrador's administration also has refused previously to grant permits for private renewable energy projects backed by foreign investors in Mexico, sparking a commercial dispute with the United States.

            The president has invested heavily in propping up the long-struggling state-owned electrical power company, and he said the new wind farms would be run by the state-owned firm.

            López Obrador has pushed legislation that gives advantages to the state-owned electric company over private energy production, which in many cases was cleaner.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804458,"Microsoft Activision merger would 'harm gamers,' UK says","The UK's antitrust watchdog said in a provisional report on Wednesday that a plan by Microsoft to buy game company Activision Blizzard would stifle competition.The result of the Competition and Markets Authority's (CMA) investigation constitutes a further hurdle for the gaming industry giant following similar concerns in the US.The CMA said that the deal — that would see Xbox-brand owner Microsoft take over one of the games industry's biggest publishers — would strengthen Microsoft's industry position, ""harming UK gamers who cannot afford expensive consoles.""The proposed $68.7 billion (€64.03 billion) deal is set to be the largest in tech industry history.It would see popular franchises Call of Duty, World of Warcraft and Candy Crash all fall into Microsoft's hands.It has seen pushback from console rival Sony — whose PlayStation machines are the main alternative to the Xbox — as well as EU and US regulators.The CMA said the merger could end up ""weakening the important rivalry"" between Xbox and PlayStation, thus reducing competition and resulting in higher prices, less innovation and fewer choices.""We have provisionally found that this may be the case here,"" CMA investigation chair Martin Coleman said.The final CMA report is expected in late April, giving time for the watchdog to seek possible solutions from all parties to address its competition concerns.But Microsoft had been hoping for a speedy resolution in the UK and EU so that it could bring back proposed remedies to the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which filed a lawsuit against the deal in December.The company is also facing other regulatory issues with the European Union as the bloc seeks to take on Big Tech, worrying that the industry has become too dominant.Regarding the Activision buyout, Microsoft has pledged to keep the Call of Duty franchise available on all platforms, addressing one of the CMA concerns.""Our commitment to grant long-term 100% equal access to 'Call of Duty' to Sony, Nintendo, Steam and others preserves the deal's benefits to gamers and developers and increases competition in the market,"" Corporate Vice President and Deputy General Counsel Rima Alaily said.""We hope between now and April we will be able to help the CMA better understand our industry to ensure they can achieve their stated mandate to promote an environment where people can be confident they are getting great choices and fair deals, [and] where competitive, fair-dealing business can innovate and thrive,"" a spokesperson for Activision Blizzard said.ab/jcg (AP, Reuters)",2023/2/8,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804459,"Turkey quake: Weak buildings, shallow shock caused deaths","The 7.8-magnitude earthquakethat struck near the Turkey-Syria border Monday and its aftershocks have caused immense damage across the area, killing more than 11,000 people and wiping out many multi-story buildings.Other earthquakes of similar magnitudes have seen much lower death counts — fatalities in the 2014 and 2015 earthquakes in Chile with respective magnitudes of 8.2 and 8.3 for example did not exceed 15.So what are the reasons for such massive destruction this time around?Videos from cities near the epicenter have captured a devastating form of collapse some call ""pancaking” — this happens when an entire building falls, each story collapsing one on top of the other. The chance of survival for someone in a pancaked building is slim.Multi-story buildings that experience this sort of destruction are likely old and have a ""soft story"" design, said Mehdi Kashani, Associate Professor of Structural and Earthquake Engineering at the University of Southampton, United Kingdom.A soft story building has floors with windows, wide doors and other openings in places where an actual solid wall would be better for withstanding an earthquake. When one of these stories is located on the bottom floor of the building, the entire structure can come down with it.Although some buildings in earthquake-prone areas along the Turkey-Syria border are now built to withstand the Earth's tremors, many were constructed before seismic design was conceived.""The basic principles started being developed in the 1960s and 70s, so it's not that old,” said Kashani. ""The Kobe earthquake (in Japan) in 1995 was a big, big, big pivot point in changing a lot of things that went wrong in that earthquake and resulted in more research. So essentially late 1990s, early 2000s, is when many of these (seismic) codes began to change.""Seismic codes are regulations governing how to build in areas close to fault lines. Buildings not constructed in lines with seismic design were especially vulnerable in Monday's earthquake.Kashani said older buildings can be retrofitted to better withstand earthquakes — this has happened in Japan and Chile, where quakes are frequent. However, he said, this requires money and political will and therefore doesn't happen everywhere it should.But the damage isn't only due to building design. The power of earthquake itself was unforgiving. According to Kashani, the quake was shallow. This means the shock of the plate tectonics colliding happened closer to the surface, making the on-ground impact much stronger than if the shock had occurred deeper in the ground and had taken a longer time to reach the surface.It's kind of like a wave in the ocean, Kashani said. Particularly massive waves will immediately knock a nearby surfer off his board. But once those waves have traveled through the ocean far enough, they'll have little impact on even the rookiest surfers.Whether an earthquake is shallow or deep helps explain why some earthquakes with relatively low magnitudes in comparison with others experience more destruction.Kashani mentioned the Bam earthquake that occurred in Iran in 2003. Despite having a magnitude of 6.3, which, in other circumstances, has resulted in few if any casualties, the shallow quake killed more than 25,000 people.Materials aren't the most crucial part of ensuring a building's capacity to withstand an earthquake, Kashani said. Structure is more important. For example, he said, with the right design, concrete can provide a great foundation to earthquake-proof a building. But if improperly structured, a concrete building can crumble like those captured in the videos coming out of Turkey and Syria.Currently seismic design allows for buildings to withstand very strong quakes without crumbling or falling down, which spares people nearby. But they still experience some damage, which Kashani said will likely improve in coming years.In the following months, researchers will travel to the area of the earthquake in Turkey and Syria to study the buildings. They will try to understand which features allowed those that didn't collapse to stay upright.Edited by: Carla Bleiker",2023/2/8,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804461,Day care in Canada struck by city bus; 2 children dead,"A city bus crashed into a day care center north of Montreal on Wednesday, killing two children and injuring six, authorities said. The driver was arrested and charged with first degree murder. 

            A neighbor who ran to the center in Laval, Quebec, said she saw children screaming and crying and watched a mother collapse. Other panicked parents were diverted to a nearby elementary school as police and emergency vehicles swarmed the area.

            Immediately after the bus plowed into the building, the driver stepped out of the bus, ripped his clothes off and started screaming, another neighbor said. 











            “He was just yelling; there were no words coming out of his mouth,” Hamdi Benchaabane said. The driver, he said, “was in a different world.”

            Pierre Ny St-Amand, 51, is facing nine charges including first degree murder, attempted murder, aggravated assault and assault causing bodily harm. He appeared in court via video late Wednesday from a hospital room and will remain detained.

            A senior Canadian government official said the crash was not a terrorist act and did not pose a threat to national security. The official spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. 

            The driver was from Laval and had worked for Societe de transport de Laval for 10 years. He had no criminal history and a clean work record, police officials and Laval Mayor Stéphane Boyer said at two separate news conferences. 

            “As of now, we don’t know the motive for the crime,"" police spokesperson Erika Landry said. She did not say why police determined the crash to be a homicide. Laval Police Chief Pierre Brochet said authorities are interviewing the driver. 

            “There is a theory that it was an intentional act, but that remains to be confirmed by the investigation,” Boyer, Laval's mayor, said.

            The dead children were both four years old, identified in the documents only by their initials.

            Six children were hospitalized with injuries that were not life-threatening, Brochet said. 

            The day care is located at the end of a driveway off a cul-de-sac. There is a bus stop on the cul-de-sac, but the driver would have had to veer off the road and head down the long driveway to hit the building.

            “There were no signs of skidmarks ... He went directly into the day care,” said another eyewitness, Mario Sirois. 

            Sirois' wife, Ginette Lamoureux, the neighbor who ran into the day care shortly after the crash, said the driver was hysterical. 

            “His eyes were like popping out,” she said.

            Benchaabane said he and three parents had to strike the driver in order to subdue him, before police cuffed him. 

            Brochet said officers at the scene were crying.

            Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his office was “following the situation closely.”

            Members of Parliament observed a moment of silence in Ottawa. 

            Wearing a hospital gown and in a bed, St-Amand was alert but unresponsive during his video appearance as the judge and his lawyer tried to get him to speak. He only nodded his head a few times when asked by his lawyer, Julien Lespérance Hudon, if he understood he was appearing in a courtroom.

            The case returns to court on Feb. 17.

            Neighbors described the suspect as a quiet, pleasant father of two young girls. One man, Thanh-Ry Tran, said his family got together with the suspect’s family a few times a year, and their wives would sometimes help each other in picking up or dropping off children. He said the suspect had never shown signs of distress.

            Another neighbor, Nader Abou-Said, said he would exchange pleasant greetings with the suspect, and would often see him playing with his daughters in the backyard.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804462,FIFA rules panel to debate more stoppage time in games,"ZURICH (AP) — The 10-plus minutes of stoppage time that were a regular feature of games at the World Cup in Qatar are back on soccer’s agenda.

            FIFA’s rule-making panel known as IFAB put additional time on the agenda published Wednesday for its annual meeting next month. Changes agreed on March 4 can take effect next season.

            Talks are scheduled on “possible measures to create fairer conditions for both teams in terms of the amount of time available in a match, with a particular focus on a stricter calculation of additional time.”











            Games of 100 minutes became routine at the last World Cup as referees followed FIFA advice to add on more accurate amounts for stoppages due to goal celebrations, injuries, video reviews and substitutions.

            The directive was part of a long-standing FIFA aim to create more active playing time on the field and give fans and viewers better value.

            It led to record-setting long games at the World Cup with a slew of stoppage-time additions of more than 10 minutes early in the tournament.

            Though a head injury helped to cause 14-plus minutes of stoppage time in the first half of England-Iran, there were more than 13 minutes added to the second half of Saudi Arabia’s stunning 2-1 win over eventual champion Argentina.

            The United States’ 1-1 draw with Wales on the second day of the tournament kicked off at 10 p.m. in Doha and finished the next day once almost 11 minutes were added to the second half.

            Organizers such as individual domestic leagues have not followed FIFA's example, though some said they were unwilling to change policy midseason and would revisit the subject in the offseason.

            FIFA trials at the Club World Cup in Morocco of live broadcasts during video reviews of communications between match officials will also be discussed at the IFAB meeting in London.

            Other subjects include allowing an extra substitute for teams when a player sustains a suspected concussion, though not the emergency temporary replacements requested by the global players’ union FIFPRO and some head injury experts. 

            The IFAB panel includes representative of FIFA and the four British soccer federations. The voting structure weighted toward FIFA means soccer's world body can veto any proposal.

            Leaving the office, Cohen told reporters he had met with prosecutors for roughly 2 1/2 hours. He wouldn't reveal details about what kinds of questions he had been asked, or where he thought the investigation was headed, but said prosecutors seemed “extremely well prepared.”

            Cohen was previously one of Trump's top lieutenants, acting as a liaison with the media and handling some of his legal and business affairs. But after federal prosecutors charged Cohen with tax evasion and criminal campaign finance violations, the two have become enemies. 

            Cohen testified before Congress that Trump's company misled banks and others about the value of its assets, helping to spur investigations that led to the Trump Organization's conviction in December on charges that it helped some of its executives avoid personal income taxes.

            The existence of the new grand jury was previously confirmed by two people familiar with the investigation, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the secret proceeding.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804465,Not just balloons: How US sees China spying as major worry,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Chinese balloon that traversed the United States before being shot down last weekend captivated public attention and drew sharp denunciations as a brazen spying effort.

            But if the vehicle for espionage seemed novel, the concept was anything but.

            In ways that are far less public, but often more worrisome, U.S. officials say, the Chinese government has been targeting U.S. industry and government agencies with spy operations designed to collect troves of commercial secrets and sensitive personal data — and to generally give the global superpower a competitive edge. 











            It's been a constant concern for law enforcement and intelligence agencies across administrations.

            ""There's a long history of spying on each other. There’s a dance and a game that both sides do. In this particular instance, maybe the Chinese got their hands caught in the cookie jar,"" said Bonnie Glaser, an Asia expert and managing director of the German Marshall Fund's Indo-Pacific program.

            China's not the only country the U.S. is concerned about, of course, but its efforts to penetrate American networks often seem more covert than noisy — in contrast, say, to the Russian hack-and-dump of Democratic emails before the 2016 presidential election. And its use of cyber spying to steal industry trade secrets, U.S. officials say, runs afoul of traditional espionage norms.

            A look at past Chinese operations:

            CYBERSECURITY CONCERNS

            FBI Director Christopher Wray has repeatedly said the Chinese government has a larger hacking program than all other countries combined, used to steal personal and corporate data and lucrative source code.

            China's government, Wray said in a speech last year, “has the global reach and presence you’d expect of the leadership of a great nation, but it refuses to act the part and too often uses its capabilities to steal and threaten, rather than to cooperate and build.” He said in a separate address in London last summer that the Chinese government “poses the biggest long-term threat to our economic and national security.” 

            The threat was laid bare in 2014 when the Justice Department, in a first-of-its-kind prosecution, charged five Chinese military officials with hacking into private sector companies in an effort to steal trade secrets.

            The following year, Chinese hackers accessed personal information on millions of federal government workers in a hack of the Office of Personnel Management. Subsequent Justice Department indictments have charged Chinese hackers with stealing information from health care insurer Anthem Inc., and with breaking into the computer networks of the Equifax credit reporting agency and obtaining the personal data of tens of millions of Americans.

            OTHER ESPIONAGE OPERATIONS

            U.S. officials have also disrupted other operations on U.S. soil that took place in person rather than behind a computer.

            A former Chicago graduate student was sentenced to eight years in prison last month for spying for the Chinese government by gathering information on scientists and engineers in the U.S. with knowledge of aerospace and satellite technology.

            The Justice Department has also alleged a more threatening type of physical surveillance, charging eight people in 2020 with working on behalf of the Chinese government in a pressure campaign aimed at coercing a New Jersey man who was wanted by Beijing into returning to China to face charges.

            TECHNOLOGY CONCERNS

            The U.S. has long warily regarded China-based companies suspected of having the potential to improperly access user data.

            U.S. officials are in private talks about the fate of TikTok, the hugely popular video app that is owned by Beijing-based ByteDance. Wray in December raised national security alarms about the company, saying China could use the app to collect data on its users and has the ability to control the app's recommendation algorithm. TikTok says it has been working to assuage those concerns.

            And the U.S. for years has taken action against Chinese tech giant Huawei, alleging that it has the capacity to facilitate spying — a claim the company vigorously denies. Last month, the Biden administration stopped approving renewal of licenses to some U.S. companies that have been selling essential components to the Chinese company.

            WHAT CHINA HAS SAID

            When it comes to the balloon itself, China has called it a civilian aircraft used for meteorological research that posed no threat and entered U.S. airspace accidentally. 

            More broadly, the Chinese Embassy in Washington has repeatedly accused the U.S. of making what it says are baseless and malicious attacks, and has said the U.S. has carried out the same type of hacking operations that it accuses Beijing of doing.

            Of course, not all U.S. investigations centered on China have proven successful. 

            The Trump administration in 2018 developed a program known as the “China Initiative"" aimed at cracking down on espionage operations, but it was rebranded last year following a monthslong review in response to complaints that the program chilled academic collaboration and contributed to anti-Asian bias. Several criminal cases against professors in the U.S. who had been accused of concealing research from China have also faltered.

            Follow Eric Tucker on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/etuckerAPWASHINGTON (AP) — The Chinese balloon that traversed the United States before being shot down last weekend captivated public attention and drew sharp denunciations as a brazen spying effort.But if the vehicle for espionage seemed novel, the concept was anything but.In ways that are far less public, but often more worrisome, U.S. officials say, the Chinese government has been targeting U.S. industry and government agencies with spy operations designed to collect troves of commercial secrets and sensitive personal data — and to generally give the global superpower a competitive edge.It's been a constant concern for law enforcement and intelligence agencies across administrations.""There's a long history of spying on each other. There’s a dance and a game that both sides do. In this particular instance, maybe the Chinese got their hands caught in the cookie jar,"" said Bonnie Glaser, an Asia expert and managing director of the German Marshall Fund's Indo-Pacific program.China's not the only country the U.S. is concerned about, of course, but its efforts to penetrate American networks often seem more covert than noisy — in contrast, say, to the Russian hack-and-dump of Democratic emails before the 2016 presidential election. And its use of cyber spying to steal industry trade secrets, U.S. officials say, runs afoul of traditional espionage norms.A look at past Chinese operations:CYBERSECURITY CONCERNSFBI Director Christopher Wray has repeatedly said the Chinese government has a larger hacking program than all other countries combined, used to steal personal and corporate data and lucrative source code.China's government, Wray said in a speech last year, “has the global reach and presence you’d expect of the leadership of a great nation, but it refuses to act the part and too often uses its capabilities to steal and threaten, rather than to cooperate and build.” He said in a separate address in London last summer that the Chinese government “poses the biggest long-term threat to our economic and national security.”The threat was laid bare in 2014 when the Justice Department, in a first-of-its-kind prosecution, charged five Chinese military officials with hacking into private sector companies in an effort to steal trade secrets.The following year, Chinese hackers accessed personal information on millions of federal government workers in a hack of the Office of Personnel Management. Subsequent Justice Department indictments have charged Chinese hackers with stealing information from health care insurer Anthem Inc., and with breaking into the computer networks of the Equifax credit reporting agency and obtaining the personal data of tens of millions of Americans.OTHER ESPIONAGE OPERATIONSU.S. officials have also disrupted other operations on U.S. soil that took place in person rather than behind a computer.A former Chicago graduate student was sentenced to eight years in prison last month for spying for the Chinese government by gathering information on scientists and engineers in the U.S. with knowledge of aerospace and satellite technology.The Justice Department has also alleged a more threatening type of physical surveillance, charging eight people in 2020 with working on behalf of the Chinese government in a pressure campaign aimed at coercing a New Jersey man who was wanted by Beijing into returning to China to face charges.TECHNOLOGY CONCERNSThe U.S. has long warily regarded China-based companies suspected of having the potential to improperly access user data.U.S. officials are in private talks about the fate of TikTok, the hugely popular video app that is owned by Beijing-based ByteDance.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804466,"Parents at school where boy, 6, shot teacher prepare to sue","NORFOLK, Va. (AP) — The families of two students at a Virginia elementary school where a 6-year-old shot and wounded his teacher have filed notices of potential legal action against the school system over trauma they say the shooting inflicted on their children.

            The parents of a first-grader said their daughter was in the classroom when the shooting occurred and “suffered emotional harm as a result.” The parents also alleged that school officials failed to protect their daughter throughout the school year from bullying, harassment and assault. 

            A letter from the other child's family cites “injuries sustained during a school shooting on January 6, 2023.” Their attorney did not elaborate further, although authorities have said that no children were physically harmed during the incident. 











            Both notices were dated Jan. 30. Newport News Public Schools provided the letters to The Associated Press after it requested them. They were first reported by the Daily Press.

            The notices were the latest fallout from a shooting that has sent shockwaves through the shipbuilding city near the Chesapeake Bay and drawn mounting criticism of school administrators. 

            Police have said the first-grade student brought his mother's 9 mm handgun to Richneck Elementary and intentionally shot his teacher, Abby Zwerner, as she was teaching her first-grade class. Zwerner, 25, was hospitalized for nearly two weeks but is now recovering at home.

            One of the legal notices was filed by “Mr. and Mrs. Anthony Nieves Jr.,” and asks the school system to preserve potential evidence, including emails regarding any student who allegedly bullied, harassed or assaulted their daughter. 

            The parents of the other student were not named in their attorney's letter, although the notice makes a similar request for the school system to preserve evidence. 

            Zwerner's attorney, Diane Toscano, recently filed her own legal notice, which lays out a series of damning allegations. 

            The document says that several hours before the shooting, at least three teachers and staff members warned school administrators that they believed the boy had brought a gun to school. The boy’s backpack was searched, but no gun was found, and administrators did not remove the boy from class, lock down the school or call police.

            Two days before the shooting, the boy allegedly “slammed” Zwerner’s cellphone and broke it, according to her claim notice. He was given a one-day suspension, but when he returned to Zwerner’s class the following day, he pulled a 9 mm handgun out of his pocket and shot her while she sat at a reading table, the notice states.

            The letter from Zwerner's attorney also states that the child constantly cursed at staff and teachers, chased students around and tried to whip them with his belt and once choked another teacher “until she couldn’t breathe.”

            In the days after the shooting, parents and teachers also lambasted school administrators for what they called a misguided emphasis on attendance over the safety of children and staff.

            The Newport News School Board fired superintendent George Parker III, while Richneck assistant principal Ebony Parker resigned. Metal detectors were also put in place at Richneck, which reopened to students on Jan. 30 after being closed for a full three weeks. 

            Police said the boy was taken to a medical facility where he is receiving unspecified services. A judge will determine what's next for the child. 

            No charges have been brought against the boy's mother, whose gun was used in the shooting. But police have said they're conducting an investigation.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804467,"Zelenskyy flies West: If it's Thursday, this must be Belgium","BRUSSELS (AP) — First, the Ukrainian president flew overhead on his way to Washington. Then on Wednesday, Volodymyr Zelenskyy flew overhead to Britain. And then to Paris. Fourth time lucky? He is now expected to stop by the European Union headquarters where the bloc's leaders meet on Thursday — security concerns permitting.

            Almost a year after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, after the EU committed tens of billions of euros in aid, provided military hardware, imposed nine packages of sanctions, and paid almost monthly visits to Kyiv, the 27-nation bloc looks set to finally get the man of the moment on its home turf. 

            Even if the novelty of the Ukraine leader traveling outside his war-torn country has somewhat worn off, Thursday's gathering with his 27 counterparts, top EU officials and legislators in Brussels is packed with political symbolism.











            After meeting with Zelenskyy in Paris on Wednesday, French President Emmanuel Macron's office confirmed that the Ukrainian leader would join EU leaders in Brussels, who “will reiterate Europeans' unwavering support to Ukraine and the Ukrainian people.”

            “If President Zelenskyy has chosen to come it is because he has an interest,” said a diplomat from a major EU nation. “Here he can address the leaders who have made the most important efforts since the war started,” added the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the visit had not been officially announced yet.

            The EU is in the midst of brokering a new sanctions package worth some 10 billion euros ahead of the Feb. 24 one-year anniversary of the war. And there is still plenty of scope for exporting more military hardware to Ukraine as a Russian spring offensive is expected.

            Furthermore, however far away Ukraine's possible membership in the EU may be, Zelenskyy appearing in his khakis and unleashing his rhetoric in the vaunted halls of European power can only add to the goodwill to help his country on to the road of accession talks.

            Ukraine is talking about joining the EU in a matter of years, while practice has shown it could take decades before aspiring members are considered fit to join. 

            Zelenskyy's visit would have been easier if a European Parliament group had not raised security concerns by leaking plans about the trip three days in advance.

            A week ago, EU top officials Charles Michel and Ursula von der Leyen visited Kyiv for a three-way summit meeting to underscore the ever-tighter relations the Russian invasion had forced both sides into.

            Overall, the EU and its member states have already made some 50 billion euros in aid available to Ukraine, and are making plans to invest heavily in reconstruction once the war ends.

            EU nations have finally started to step up their military contributions as well. 

            Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands announced Tuesday that they plan to provide Ukraine with at least 100 refurbished German-made Leopard 1 battle tanks in the coming months. The announcement followed Germany agreeing last month to allow deliveries of the more modern Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine. 

            The order of Zelenskyy's foreign trips also was an indication of the EU's position in the Western political pecking order as far as Kyiv is concerned. After being feted by U.S. president Biden around Christmas, Zelenskyy went to Britain and France. All three are U.N. Security Council members and nuclear powers. Germany, as Europe's economic juggernaut, got an invite at the table with Macron. 

            “He knows well that it’s not the EU itself which has tanks, and that he needs to speak with member states,” the diplomat put it. 

            Which perhaps, more than anything, brings Zelenskyy to Brussels.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804479,Tennessee House speaker mulls rejecting US education money,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — One of Tennessee's most influential Republican lawmakers says the state should stop accepting the nearly $1.8 billion of federal K-12 education dollars that help provide support for low-income students, English learners and students with disabilities.

            House Speaker Cameron Sexton told The Associated Press that he has introduced a bill to explore the idea during this year’s legislative session and has begun discussions with Gov. Bill Lee and other key GOP lawmakers. 

            “Basically, we'll be able to educate the kids how Tennessee sees fit,” Sexton said, pointing that rejecting the money would mean that Tennessee would no longer have “federal government interference.""











            To date, no state has successfully rejected federal education funds even as state and local officials have long grumbled about some of the requirements and testing that at times come attached to the money. The idea has also come up elsewhere in recent months among GOP officials, including in Oklahoma and South Carolina.

            Many Republican politicians and candidates at the federal level have also made a habit of calling for the outright elimination of the U.S. Department of Education.

            According to Sexton, Tennessee is currently in the financial position to use state tax dollars to replace federal education funds. He pointed to the $3.2 billion in new spending outlined in Gov. Lee’s recent budget proposal for the upcoming fiscal year as proof that the state could easily cover the federal government’s portion. 

            Federal dollars make up a small slice of Tennessee's K-12 education funding, which had an almost $8.3 billion budget as of fiscal year 2023. Yet the federal money is seen as a key tool to supporting schools in low-income areas and special education. 

            Sexton says he has been mulling the proposal for a while, but this week, he publicly touted the idea in front of a packed room full of lawmakers, lobbyists and other leaders at the Tennessee Farm Bureau luncheon on Tuesday. 

            “We as a state can lead the nation once again in telling the federal government that they can keep their money and we'll just do things the Tennessee way,” Sexton said at the event. “And that should start, first and foremost, with the Department of Education.”

            Spokespersons for both Gov. Lee and Sen. Randy McNally appeared open to entertaining Sexton's proposal. 

            “Although we haven’t seen the details of the legislation yet, the governor is always interested in working with the speaker to ensure Tennessee students have the best access to a high-quality education,"" said Lee's spokesperson, Jade Byers.

            McNally said he was open to the proposal, saying that “federal mandates in the area of education can be overly burdensome.”

            “McNally thinks a discussion about forgoing this money, a relatively small part of overall education funding, in order to maintain more control over how we educate our Tennessee students is a constructive conversation to have,” spokesperson Adam Kleinheider said. 

            Democratic Rep. Bo Mitchell said he had several concerns about forgoing federal education funding, particularly knowing that the money currently goes to support students with disabilities and low-income students.

            “I'm concerned about their rights and Tennessee being able to provide those services and uphold their rights,” Mitchell said.

            Advocacy groups also raised alarm, with the Tennessee Disability Coalition saying they were “very disappointed” with Sexton's proposal.

            “These funds represent the best, strongest bootstraps these students have for successfully living and working in our communities,” spokesperson Tom Jedlowski said.

            Meanwhile, the Tennessee Education Association's President Tanya Coats said Tennessee needs “every dollar we can invest” even if it comes with “federal strings.”

            In Republican-dominant Tennessee, GOP lawmakers have increasingly become more skeptical and combative over what is taught inside public classrooms — particularly over race and gender issues — and the policies surrounding what services schools offer to students.

            To push back against these attacks, advocates have generally leveraged various federal funds the state receives as grounds to block or challenge various school-related bans. This has resulted in state and federal education officials often being at odds with each other.

            For example, last September, the U.S. Department of Education reprimanded Tennessee for how it was carrying out statewide testing, saying its problems “impact the state’s ability to provide clear and transparent information to the public about school performance, but also result in the state using information that is not comparable across schools.”

            Tennessee was among the states to sue President Joe Biden ’s administration over a U.S. Department of Agriculture school meal program that prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.

            The lawsuit came after the USDA announced in May that it would include discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity as a violation of Title IX, the sweeping 1972 law that guarantees equity between the sexes in “any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” 

            And in 2021, the federal department opened investigations into Tennessee and four other Republican-led states that have banned or limited mask requirements in schools, saying the policies could amount to discrimination against students with disabilities or health conditions. 

            Yet it’s unclear whether Tennessee would have fewer conflicts with the federal government if the state chose to forgo the education funding. While the U.S. Constitution says public education is a state responsibility, states are still required to follow federal laws.

            Separately, in January, Tennessee sparked national attention when state’s Department of Health announced it was walking away from nearly $9 million in federal funding designed to prevent and treat HIV. 

            In a letter sent to providers, the state announced that it believes “it is in the best interest of Tennesseans for the state to assume direct financial and managerial responsibility for these services.”NASHVILLE, Tenn.

Bo Mitchell said he had several concerns about forgoing federal education funding, particularly knowing that the money currently goes to support students with disabilities and low-income students.“I'm concerned about their rights and Tennessee being able to provide those services and uphold their rights,” Mitchell said.Advocacy groups also raised alarm, with the Tennessee Disability Coalition saying they were “very disappointed” with Sexton's proposal.“These funds represent the best, strongest bootstraps these students have for successfully living and working in our communities,” spokesperson Tom Jedlowski said.Meanwhile, the Tennessee Education Association's President Tanya Coats said Tennessee needs “every dollar we can invest” even if it comes with “federal strings.”In Republican-dominant Tennessee, GOP lawmakers have increasingly become more skeptical and combative over what is taught inside public classrooms — particularly over race and gender issues — and the policies surrounding what services schools offer to students.To push back against these attacks, advocates have generally leveraged various federal funds the state receives as grounds to block or challenge various school-related bans. This has resulted in state and federal education officials often being at odds with each other.For example, last September, the U.S. Department of Education reprimanded Tennessee for how it was carrying out statewide testing, saying its problems “impact the state’s ability to provide clear and transparent information to the public about school performance, but also result in the state using information that is not comparable across schools.”Tennessee was among the states to sue President Joe Biden ’s administration over a U.S. Department of Agriculture school meal program that prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.The lawsuit came after the USDA announced in May that it would include discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity as a violation of Title IX, the sweeping 1972 law that guarantees equity between the sexes in “any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”And in 2021, the federal department opened investigations into Tennessee and four other Republican-led states that have banned or limited mask requirements in schools, saying the policies could amount to discrimination against students with disabilities or health conditions.Yet it’s unclear whether Tennessee would have fewer conflicts with the federal government if the state chose to forgo the education funding. While the U.S. Constitution says public education is a state responsibility, states are still required to follow federal laws.Separately, in January, Tennessee sparked national attention when state’s Department of Health announced it was walking away from nearly $9 million in federal funding designed to prevent and treat HIV.In a letter sent to providers, the state announced that it believes “it is in the best interest of Tennesseans for the state to assume direct financial and managerial responsibility for these services.”",2023/2/9,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804481,"In new role, Sanders demands answers from Starbucks' Schultz","WASHINGTON (AP) — As Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders settles into his new role as chairman of the Senate committee that oversees health and labor issues, he says some corporations “should be nervous.” And the longtime liberal crusader’s first target is Howard Schultz, the interim CEO of Starbucks who has aggressively fought his workers’ efforts to unionize. 

            Sanders and the 10 other Democrats on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee sent a letter to Schultz on Tuesday demanding he testify at a March 9 hearing on his company’s compliance with federal labor laws. If Schultz ignores or refuses the request, Sanders said, he’s willing to use the committee’s subpoena power to force him to appear. 

            “This is corporate greed,” said Sanders, 81, who has run for president twice and spent a political lifetime fighting corporations and monied interests over policies that he said hurt the working class. “Workers have a constitutional right to organize. And even if you are a large, multinational corporation owned by a billionaire you don’t have the right to violate the law. And we intend to be asking Mr. Schultz some very hard questions.” 











            Starbucks spokesman Andrew Trull said the company is reviewing the letter and “we will continue our ongoing dialogue with key stakeholders, including the chairman's office to offer clarifying information in reference to these issues.” He did not say whether Schultz will appear.

            Sanders’ demand for testimony from Schultz is an opening act in his new role as chairman of the HELP panel, which has expansive jurisdiction over issues that have been central to his more than four decades in public service. And thanks to Democrats adding a seat to their majority in last year's election, Sanders can fully exercise the oversight powers of the gavel and potentially issue subpoenas without Republican support.

            Sanders said he’s not done challenging individual corporations, mentioning Amazon as another company he believes has acted illegally against unions. And “if you are a multinational pharmaceutical company that’s been ripping off the American people and charging us outrageously high prices, you should be nervous, because I’m going to hold you accountable,” he said in an interview with The Associated Press on Tuesday. “I’m going to do something about it.” 

            It's unclear how much he can accomplish in a divided Congress. While the committee will serve as a bully pulpit for the Senate’s most famous progressive, passing significant legislation through the Senate — not to mention the Republican-led House – will be a heavy-to-impossible lift over the next two years. And finding areas of consensus will be a new test for the cantankerous far-left senator as he is watched uneasily by the industries he regulates and members of his own committee from both parties. 

            Sanders said he has “two roles”— one as chairman, with a more realistic focus on results, and another promoting his signature issues like “Medicare for All,” tuition-free college and paid child care, among others. He said he plans to take his “show on the road,” doing a series of town halls, roundtables and field hearings around the country. Next week, he’ll hold a town hall inside the Capitol, bringing teachers unions together to discuss teacher pay. 

            “I am chairman of the committee and I want to accomplish as much as I can … that’s what I’m paid to do and I intend to do it,” he said. “On the other hand, there are issues out there that I do not expect will be passed in this Congress, but are very important and they have to be talked about.” 

            Republicans are skeptical Sanders can make the kinds of deals necessary to push significant legislation through the committee. 

            Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, a Republican on the panel, said Sanders’ style is “a lot of storm and fury” and light on real accomplishments, meaning “little will be done to get through the committee, and very little will reach the floor.” 

            Sanders and his Democratic allies point to bipartisan deals he has made in the past, along with some of his unexpected relationships he's made with Republicans who share slices of his interests. While he spends most of his time talking about his progressive goals, they said, he is also an 16-year veteran of the Senate with an ability to compromise. 

            For his part, Sanders noted his deal with the late Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., to improve veterans’ benefits almost 10 years ago and his work with former rival President Joe Biden, who beat him in the 2020 Democratic primary, to pass COVID relief policy in 2021 and negotiate a massive package of social spending programs that next year. That legislation ultimately stalled. 

            On the bipartisan veterans’ legislation, which aimed to improve access to health care after a series of controversies, “he put his heart and soul in it,” said Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, the previous chairwoman of the HELP committee and a member of the Veterans panel while Sanders and McCain were negotiating. “He learned, he listened, he compromised.” 

            Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said Sanders often has a differing view than those in the caucus, “but he usually ends up where the team is.” 

            Sanders ticked off Republicans he has worked with — moderate Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, for example, both of whom sit on the committee and have deep interest in rural health issues. He said he’s holding regular meetings with Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, the top Republican on the panel who is known for compromise. 

            And this week, Sanders is holding a news conference with Sen. Mike Braun, an Indiana Republican who is on the panel, to demand that railroads provide workers with more sick days. 

            Braun said he's met with Sanders to discuss health care, and while they come at it from opposite angles — Sanders wants it to be government-run, Braun wants to reform the industry to lower costs — they fundamentally agree that there are problems. “When you take everything else away, people are still worried about the high cost of health care,” Braun said. 

            Outside of the Capitol, health insurance industry experts are watching what moves Sanders might make around Medicare Advantage, an increasingly popular program where private companies offer plans that are reimbursed by the government for care. Others like health care worker unions are eager to work with Sanders as hospitals around the country grapple with staff shortages and health care worker burnout.

            With his new perch, Sanders seems inclined to stay in the Senate. He said he’s not interested in replacing the departing Labor Secretary, Marty Walsh, and refuses to talk about his own political future at all. 

            “I intend to use this committee to address the real issues are facing working class people,” he said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804482,Who has next for James' scoring record: Luka? Tatum? Anyone?,"James Harden averaged 36 points a few seasons ago. Devin Booker once scored 70 in one game.

            There are many more players doing much more scoring now than when LeBron James began his NBA career in 2003-04. Tracy McGrady led the league with 28 points per game that season, a mark that nine players would currently be surpassing.

            With the faster pace of play and the plethora of 3-pointers, there are plenty of chances for players to pile up the points. But a look at Harden shows how hard it will be for even an elite scorer to keep doing it long enough to challenge wherever the scoring mark is when James finally retires.











            He averaged 36.1 points in 2019-20 and 34.3 the next season. Maintain those kinds of numbers for 75 games a season and a player would be flirting with 40,000 points in a mere 15 years — though that still probably wouldn't be enough to reach where James will put the record that's now 38,390.

            But then circumstances changed. A trade first to Brooklyn and then Philadelphia meant having to share shots with fellow All-Stars, and a severe hamstring injury robbed Harden of much of his explosiveness. He hasn't even averaged 25 points since and now doesn't get much past 20.

            Count Booker among those who think James will never be caught.

            “You might be able to do it for five seasons or 10, but 20 seasons at what he’s done, I don’t think it will ever be done again,” the Phoenix Suns star said.

            Still, perhaps there are some players who will have a chance. Maybe it's Luka Doncic, who like James has lived up to the hype that followed him into the NBA. Or maybe it's Victor Wembanyama, who will try to do the same starting next season.

            Maybe it's a player who hasn't even been born yet, just as James wasn't when Kareem Abdul-Jabbar set the previous record in 1984.

            Here's a look at some of the possibilities:

            — Jayson Tatum, Boston: Tatum went toe-to-toe with James in the 2018 Eastern Conference finals, when he finished with more points in a postseason than any rookie other than Abdul-Jabbar. The All-NBA forward averaged better than 26 points the last two seasons, is at nearly 31 per game this one and doesn't turn 25 until next month. Keep up this season's average for the next 13 and he could be toe-to-toe with James again.

            — Luka Doncic, Dallas. Playing professionally in Spain before coming to the U.S. had him ready to make a quick splash in the NBA, and he's averaged better than 27 points in four of his five seasons. Doncic already has racked up more than 8,500 points and he won’t even turn 24 until the end of this month. He's far more than just a scorer, perhaps more likely to surpass Russell Westbrook's career record for triple-doubles.

            — Devin Booker, Phoenix. Booker can get as hot as anybody in the league, as he showed when he scored 70 points in Boston in 2017 at 20 years old, or when he had three straight with 40 or more in December. The guard just turned 26 a few months ago and already has 12,000 points. Do a little better than his 27.1 points per game this season for 12 more years and he could make things interesting. 

            — Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee. Perhaps he never really had a chance at the career scoring record after managing just 525 points (6.8 per game) as a rookie. But few players work harder to improve than the Greek Freak, who may have replaced James as the NBA's most unstoppable athletic force. He just turned 28 and is in his fourth straight season averaging better than 28 points. Do that for the next 10 years and he could be up near the 38,000-point range.

            — Victor Wembanyama, France. The 19-year-old forward will arrive in the NBA in June as the most hyped prospect since James 20 years earlier. At 7-foot-3 but with shooting range and ballhandling skills of a player much smaller, he has numerous ways to score. And he'd need to do plenty of it to catch James.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804489,Chasing Horse charged with federal crimes in sex abuse probe,"NORTH LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) — A former “Dances With Wolves” actor accused of sexually abusing Indigenous women and girls for decades was charged with federal crimes Wednesday, adding to the growing list of criminal cases against Nathan Chasing Horse since his arrest last week in Nevada.

            Chasing Horse, 46, now faces two counts of sexual exploitation of children and one count of possession of child pornography, according to a criminal complaint filed Wednesday afternoon in Nevada U.S. District Court. Authorities have said Chasing Horse filmed sexual assaults.

            The federal charges came hours after a state judge on Wednesday granted $300,000 bail to Chasing Horse, who has been in Las Vegas police custody since his Jan. 31 arrest near the home he shared with his five wives. 











            Earlier Wednesday, about two dozen of Chasing Horse's relatives and friends had filed into a North Las Vegas courtroom in a show of support, hoping he would be released on bail. They cheered and celebrated the judge's decision as they left the courthouse, waving signs that translate to “Justice for Chasing Horse.” Now, if he posts bail, he is likely to be taken into federal custody.

            In state court, Chasing Horse is charged with eight felonies, including sexual assault, sex trafficking and child abuse. He has not entered a plea.

            Canadian police in British Columbia confirmed this week they also are pursuing a criminal case against the former actor, who is known for his portrayal of Smiles A Lot in Kevin Costner's 1990 Oscar-winning film. He is accused in a 2018 sexual assault in the British Columbia village of Keremeos near the Washington state border.

            Authorities in Nevada have said his crimes date to the early 2000s and stretch across the United States and into Canada.

            It wasn't immediately clear how, if at all, the federal charges will affect Chasing Horse's case in Clark County. His public defender, Kristy Holston, did not immediately respond Wednesday evening to a request for comment.

            At his bail hearing Wednesday morning, Clark County Chief Deputy District Attorney William Rowles told the judge that Chasing Horse should remain in custody because he was “grooming” girls to replace his older wives at the time of his arrest. 

            “There is evidence that this individual is still in the process of grooming young children to replace the others as they grow up,” Rowles said.

            Nevada authorities have described Chasing Horse in more than a hundred pages of court documents as the leader of a cult known as The Circle, whose followers believed Chasing Horse, as a “medicine man,” could communicate with higher beings. Police said he abused that position to physically and sexually assault women and girls and take underage wives.

            At its peak, Rowles said, The Circle had about 300 members.

            Investigators and victims had been expected to speak in court Wednesday, because Nevada law requires prosecutors to show convincing evidence that a defendant should remain jailed as they await trial. But after delays in the proceedings, the judge heard only from Rowles, who requested $2 million bail, and Holston, who asked the judge to set bail at $50,000.

            After the hearing, Holston told The Associated Press she also was happy with the judge's decision and said she is looking forward to his next court date in North Las Vegas, currently scheduled for Feb. 22. At that hearing, a judge is expected to hear evidence in the case and decide whether Chasing Horse will stand trial.

            “We’re really looking forward to the preliminary hearing in this case,” she said, “because it’s another public hearing where we will have an opportunity to point out the weaknesses in the state’s case.”

            Rulon Pete, a representative of the victims and the executive director of the Las Vegas Indian Center, said they were disappointed with the judge's decision. Some of the victims were in the courtroom Wednesday.

            “What happened this morning was like a slap in the face,” Pete told The Associated Press.

            Police have said they have identified at least six victims, including one who was 13 when she said she was abused, and another who said she was offered to Chasing Horse as a “gift” when she was 15.

            Chasing Horse was born on the Rosebud Reservation in South Dakota, home to the Sicangu Sioux, one of the seven tribes of the Lakota nation. In 2015, he was banished from the Fort Peck Reservation in Poplar, Montana, following allegations of human trafficking.NORTH LAS VEGAS, Nev.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804491,Zimbabwe survives final session to grab draw vs West Indies,"BULAWAYO, Zimbabwe (AP) — Zimbabwe’s lower-order batters held out in the final session of the last day, including a 36-ball zero from Wellington Masakadza, to force a draw in the first cricket test against West Indies.

            The hosts finished at 134-6 on Wednesday in 54 overs after being set 272 to win. 

            West Indies openers Kraigg Brathwaite and Tagenarine Chanderpaul had resumed the day at 21 without loss in the second innings — after sharing a stand of 336 in the first innings — and the visitors went on to declare at 203-5 soon after lunch. Masakadza returned bowling figures of 3-71, including the wickets of top scorers Raymon Reifer (caught and bowled for 58) and Jermaine Blackwood (caught behind for 57).











            Zimbabwe was praised for accepting the challenge and going for the win before finding itself in trouble.

            “To see Zimbabwe come back and force their way back into the game, and pushing for victory, says a lot about test cricket,” Brathwaite said. “I believe test cricket is alive. For the players, test cricket is about fighting for their country. Zimbabwe did that, that’s test cricket for you.”

            Zimbabwe will be happiest with the result, given how Windies’ late bowling surge gave the visitors a real possibility of winning before debutant wicketkeeper Tafadzwa Tsiga (24 not out) and Masakadza helped their team survive at the Queens Sports Club.

            Left-arm spinner Gudakesh Motie took 4-50 for West Indies.

            Brathwaite, who scored 182 in the first innings, said his team had sensed victory when Zimbabwe fell to 120-6.

            “We wanted to take 10 wickets, that was the focus,"" the West Indies captain said, ""but we knew it was going to be difficult on that pitch, and Zimbabwe batted well.”

            Zimbabwe's wickets had tumbled quickly Wednesday, including the dismissal of former England batter Gary Ballance (18), who hit a debut century in the first innings to become the second player after Kepler Wessels (Australia and South Africa) to score a test ton for two different countries. 

            Zimbabwe showed intent in the rain-affected match on a largely lifeless wicket. Zimbabwe coach Dave Houghton, the former captain, has been credited for instilling a sense of confidence in his team since returning in June for a second spell as coach.

            West Indies also declared its first innings, at 447-6, as Chanderpaul hit a double century. Zimbabwe leg-spinner Brandon Mavuta, playing his first test in five years, was effective on the slow and low pitch, taking a five-for, before he joined Ballance (137 not out) to lead a crucial fightback as the hosts declared on 379-9 in the first innings.

            Zimbabwe, backed by a small but vociferous crowd, has been playing remarkably well in white-ball cricket over the past seven months when Houghton returned as coach, and it was keen to take the form into tests.

            Assistant coach Stuart Matsikenyeri, a former Zimbabwe batter, said both teams went all out to win.

            “No, I don’t think the West Indies took us for granted,” Matsikenyeri said. “With the way we have been playing lately, I don’t think anyone would take us for granted. They are a proud team, and they wanted to win … we came into the test match expecting to stay in the game, be positive. And being positive means winning. 

            “There were different phases, in some phases we were on top, in some we were not. That’s the nature of test cricket. When we realized that we were not going to win after all, the next thing was to draw.”

            The second and final test begins on Sunday, after which West Indies will cross into South Africa for a multi-format series.

Zimbabwe leg-spinner Brandon Mavuta, playing his first test in five years, was effective on the slow and low pitch, taking a five-for, before he joined Ballance (137 not out) to lead a crucial fightback as the hosts declared on 379-9 in the first innings.Zimbabwe, backed by a small but vociferous crowd, has been playing remarkably well in white-ball cricket over the past seven months when Houghton returned as coach, and it was keen to take the form into tests.Assistant coach Stuart Matsikenyeri, a former Zimbabwe batter, said both teams went all out to win.“No, I don’t think the West Indies took us for granted,” Matsikenyeri said. “With the way we have been playing lately, I don’t think anyone would take us for granted. They are a proud team, and they wanted to win … we came into the test match expecting to stay in the game, be positive. And being positive means winning.“There were different phases, in some phases we were on top, in some we were not. That’s the nature of test cricket. When we realized that we were not going to win after all, the next thing was to draw.”The second and final test begins on Sunday, after which West Indies will cross into South Africa for a multi-format series.___More AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/2/9,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804497,"Dylan Moore, Seattle finalize 3-year deal for nearly $8.9M","SEATTLE (AP) — Dylan Moore and the Seattle Mariners finalized a three-year contract worth $8,875,000.

            He gets a $250,000 signing bonus as part of the deal announced Wednesday and salaries of $2 million this year, $3.05 million in 2024 and $3,575,000 in 2025.

            Moore's 2025 salary would increases by $250,000 if he has 400 or more plate appearances in 2024.











            The 30-year-old utilityman would have been eligible for free agency after the 2024 World Series.

            Moore had asked for a raise from $1.35 million to $2.25 million, and the Mariners had offered $1.9 million when proposed arbitration figures were exchanged on Jan. 13.

            Moore played every position except pitcher and catcher last year, including 39 games in right field, seven in center, 18 in left, two at third base, 26 at shortstop, 12 at second, eight at first and three at designated hitter.

            He is expected to play more second base this season, sharing time with Kolten Wong, and also is likely to spell J.P. Crawford at shortstop. 

            Moore was selected by Texas in the seventh round of the 2015 amateur draft, traded to Atlanta a year later and then released by the Braves in March 2018. He signed with Milwaukee, was released at the end of the season and then signed with Seattle that November.

            Moore made his big league debut in March 2019 when Seattle played Oakland in Tokyo.

            He hit .224 with six homers and 24 RBIs last year, down from 12 homers, 43 RBIs and a .181 batting average in 2021. Moore is a .208 career hitter with 35 homers and 112 RBIs.

            Outfielder Teoscar Hernández, acquired by the Mariners from Toronto, also remains on track for a hearing. He asked for a raise from $10.65 million to $16 million, and Seattle offered $14 million.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804499,"In earthquake rescues, noisy gear and digging, then silence","ADANA, Turkey (AP) — They lifted slabs of cement with enormous cranes and smashed rubble with jackhammers. Then, they stopped. 

            Silence. 

            Key to detecting the faintest noise, which could be the sign of a survivor buried beneath rubble from Monday's quake in Turkey and Syria. 











            Among the wreckage of a collapsed 14-story building in the Turkish city of Adana, the shriek of a whistle pierced the noise every few minutes on Wednesday. Rescue workers hollered for quiet, and listened for any hint of voices from the debris. Hundreds of people watching hushed.

            During one moment of digging, Volunteer Bekir Bicer uncovered a crushed birdcage, he said. Inside was a blue-and-yellow bird, alive after nearly 60 hours.

            “I was very happy. I nearly cried,” Bicer said. “The cage was broken, but the bird was still inside.”

            Friends and family of the trapped sat beside fires, waiting for a miracle even as the survival window for those trapped under the rubble was closing.

            Suat Yarkan, 50, said his aunt and her two daughters lived in an apartment on the building’s fourth floor. They would have been home asleep when the quake struck. He was desperate for hope that they could be rescued alive.

            “Look at the bird. Sixty hours,” he said. “It makes me feel like maybe God is helping us ... I have to believe that they will recover everyone.”

            Regular moments of silence are essential to such operations, said David Alexander, professor of emergency planning and management at University College London.

            “We often find helicopters chattering overhead, making a huge noise and sometimes also blowing up dust whilst the teams are desperately trying to listen for any kind of noise that might indicate someone alive and moving under the rubble,” he said.

            Sophisticated rescue teams will use microphones to pick up faint noises, while specially trained dogs and fiber-optic cameras pick up heat inside mounds of debris. But given the need to move quickly, and the limited number of rescue teams deployed across a huge area, cries for help are key.

            “If a person can attract attention under the rubble, their chance of being saved is about three times higher than it would be if they’re in a coma, statistically speaking,” Alexander said.

            As the sun set Wednesday for the third time on devastated cities and towns in Turkey and Syria, the push to recover survivors became more urgent as the lack of food and water, bitterly cold weather and potential injuries grew even more acute. 

            Prospects for finding survivors almost three days after the quake are narrow, experts say.

            “The first 72 hours are considered to be critical as the condition of people trapped and injured can deteriorate quickly and become fatal if they are not rescued and given medical attention in time,” said Steven Godby, an expert in natural hazards at Nottingham Trent University in England.

            In Adana on Wednesday, rescue workers at another collapsed building draped a white sheet across a recess in the mound of debris, obscuring the view of what they’d discovered there.

            The digging machines came to a stop, and a stretcher was pulled behind the sheet as the workers looked on in silence.

            An ancient city of more than 2 million inhabitants just 20 miles (32 km) from the Mediterranean Sea, Adana has experienced earthquakes before. A 6.3 magnitude tremor in 1998 killed nearly 150 people in the city and its surroundings, and left thousands homeless.

            This week's stronger quake left a large number of Adana’s buildings, many of them modern, seemingly untouched. Many high-rise apartment buildings appeared entirely undamaged. On the city’s northern fringe, however, several 14-story buildings collapsed.

            As of Tuesday night, Turkey’s government reported that 167 people had been killed by the earthquake in Adana, with others still trapped beneath the rubble. That was only a tenth of the deaths reported in the devastated Hatay province, miles away.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804500,Oil major TotalEnergies doubles annual profit to $36 billion,"PARIS (AP) — France's TotalEnergies SE doubled its profits in 2022, joining other international oil and gas companies in fattening their bottom lines as high energy prices surged after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

            Adjusted net income rose to $36.2 billion, up from $18.1 billion in 2021, the company said Wednesday. Earnings benefited from robust refinery use that let the company capture high profits for turning crude into other fuel products. 

            The figures looked different under international accounting rules that included write-offs on Total's assets in Russia, where doing business has been severely complicated by Western sanctions over the war. Under IFRS accounting standards, net profit was $20.5 billion, lower than the adjusted profit figure because it included $15 billion in write-offs on its Russian businesses.











            Big oil company profits have led to calls for governments to tax more of those gains as households and businesses face higher utility bills. Energy giants Shell, BP and Exxon also have recently reported record earnings, triggering demands that the fossil fuel industry do more to offset high energy bills as well as cut climate-damaging carbon emissions.

            Activists from groups Friends of the Earth and Alternatiba splattered red paint on the entrance to TotalEnergies’ towering headquarters Wednesday in the Paris suburb of La Defense. They posted images of themselves reading “Superprofits — You’re cashing in, we’re suffering” and accused the company of “climate-killing and criminal activities.”

            Oil prices surged to over $120 last year on fears of lost Russian supply as Western buyers turned away from Moscow's crude amid the war in Ukraine. Crude prices have eased lately amid global economic slowdowns and because less Russian oil has been lost to the market than originally feared. 

            
                Natural gas prices also surged to record highs in Europe as Russia largely cut supplies to the continent. While they have since fallen, they are three times higher than before Russia massed troops on the border of Ukraine.

            TotalEnergies said in its earnings release that it paid $33 billion in taxes during 2022, most of it to countries where it produces oil and natural gas. 

            The company's board of directors proposed to increase its dividend to shareholders for 2022 by 6.5%, to 2.81 euros ($3.02) per share, plus the special dividend of 1 euro per share paid out in December.PARIS (AP) — France's TotalEnergies SE doubled its profits in 2022, joining other international oil and gas companies in fattening their bottom lines as high energy prices surged after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.Adjusted net income rose to $36.2 billion, up from $18.1 billion in 2021, the company said Wednesday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804501,"Ukraine updates: Zelenskyy tours Europe, combat intensifies","Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy embarked on a rare foreign trip on Wednesday for talks with European allies.The president started off in the UK, where he appealed for donations of fighter jets for Ukraine. He spoke in the House of Commons, parliament's lower chamber, held talks with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, and had an audience with King Charles III. 
You can read the story in full here.By Wednesday evening, Zelenskyy was expected in Paris for a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.And rumors were rife, albeit unconfirmed, that the Ukrainian leader would then move on to Brussels on Thursday to attend the start of a monthly EU summit after his talks with the leaders of the bloc's biggest two economies.Here are some of the other notable developments concerning the war in Ukraine on Wednesday, February 8.Reports of intensifying fighting on the front lines continued to gather pace as both Russia and Ukraine claimed to have inflicted heavy casualties on the opposing sides.Ukraine's military said overnight that 1,030 Russian troops had been killed over a 24-hour period, the highest daily toll of the war.The figure could not be independently verified, nor could Russia's claim of having inflicted 6,500 Ukrainian casualties in the month of January.But the reports appear to corroborate both sides' accounts of intensified fighting, in particular around the city of Bakhmut.A Ukrainian official told Reuters that Kyiv was also reckoning with a fresh offensive ""in either the Kharkiv or Zaporizhzhia direction."" The one-year anniversary of Russia's February 24 invasion is approaching, and observers believe the Kremlin is likely keen to secure something it can present to a domestic audience as progress ahead of that date.German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius — who on Tuesday made his first foreign trip since taking office, going to Kyiv — moved on to Warsaw on Wednesday.Pistorius called on more European partners to join a German-Polish project looking to deliver Leopard 2 battle tanks to Ukraine.He said that he and Poland's Defense Minister Mariusz Blaszczak and their Ukrainian counterpart Oleksij Reznikov were planning to invite partners a meeting for next week.""It is now more important than ever that we really start putting all levers into motion and endeavor to mobilize all means that have not yet been activated, so that Ukraine can be supported in its defense against Russia,"" Pistorius said. He said that for a few western allies, there was still ""scope to do more.""Germany itself has faced allegations of dragging its feet on military aid decisions for Ukraine, not least from Poland. Since taking office last month, Pistorius has tried to turn the argument around and focus on how much Berlin has done despite its historical post-war restrictions on arming hot conflicts.Somewhat unusually, a joint press conference was not scheduled with Blaszczak. Poland's governing PiS party faces nationalelections later in the year and has been critical of Germany publicly on a host of issues in recent months.The White House, the US State Department and the CIA have all called a new blog post published by investigative journalist Seymour Hersh claiming that the US was behind the destruction of the Nord Stream gas pipelines last year and that Joe Biden authorized the operation ""utterly false and a complete fiction.""Officials said as much both in response to Hersh's own requests for comment and publicly on Wednesday.Russia, meanwhile, said the US had questions to answer following the publication. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova shared a link to the lengthy blog post published on Substack online, and said: ""The White House must now comment on all these facts.""Hersh's article, which leans heavily on unnamed sources, claims explosives were planted on the pipelines during an unrelated diving exercise and then remotely triggered at a later date.Investigators in Sweden and Denmark, in whose waters the ruptures occurred, have so far said that the damage was caused in an act of sabotage, but have not said who they believe was responsible.Hersh is one of the US' most renowned investigative journalists, having had a hand in groundbreaking reports on issues like exposing the My Lai massacre in Vietnam, covering the Watergate scandal, and reporting on US mistreatment of prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq.However, in recent years his critics allege that he's drifted into conspiracy theorist territory, for instance over his critical claims regarding the killing of Osama bin Laden and who might be behind chemical weapons usage in Syria.Despite decades at top publications including the New Yorker and the New York Times, he published his latest story in a personal capacity.A multi-national investigation team, not supported by Russia, has concluded that President Vladimir Putin played an active role in authorizing the shooting down of the MH17 passenger plane over eastern Ukraine in 2014.Investigators said there were ""strong indications"" that the decision to offer the missiles used to shoot the plane to pro-Russian rebels was taken by Putin. However, they said the did not have evidence of Putin being involved in the shooting itself.Investigators also said they were halting their work, having exhausted their lines of investigation.You can read the story in full here.German Chancellor Olaf Scholz told the Bundestag parliament on Wednesday that Vladimir Putin ""will not achieve his goals"" in Ukraine.""[President Vladimir] Putin will not achieve his goals — not on the battlefield and not through a dictated peace. That much, at least, is certain after a year of war,"" Scholz told the Bundestag.He also sought to assure Ukraine, ahead of his meeting with Zelenskyy in Paris, that its ultimate future was as a part of the EU.You can read the story in full here.China and Ukraine have maintained a ""strategic partnership"" for years.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804502,Sweden issues rare ban over Quran burning rally,"Swedish police on Wednesday refused to grant permission to a planned rally that would have included the burning of a Quran — a rare move by the Swedish authorities.The effective ban follows a similar stunt in January which saw a far-right politician burning the Muslim holy book close to the Turkish embassy in Stockholm last month — the same place Thursday's protest had been planned for.But Sweden's security service, Sapo, said that the January rally had increased the risk of attacks against Sweden, citing this in its reason for refusing to greenlight another such protest.""The burning of the Koran outside Turkey embassy in January 2023 can be determined to have increased threats against both the Swedish society at large, but also against Sweden, Swedish interests abroad and Swedes abroad,"" the police decision said.""Sweden has become a higher priority target for attacks.""The fallout of the previous book burning was not limited to anti-Swedish protests across the Muslim world.Turkey responded by canceling a visit from Sweden's defense minister to Ankara for a planned meeting to discuss Sweden's accession into NATO, while Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told Sweden to not count on its support.The incident has caused diplomatic headaches for Sweden which must have unanimous approval to join the NATO alliance — a decision it took following the Russian invasion of Ukraine.Erdogan had said that Turkey would not approve the Swedish bid as long as Quran burnings were allowed. Protests are rarely banned in Sweden, being considered protected under the freedom of assembly.Swedish police said that Thursday's rally had not been called for by the same far-right politician, but by a little-known association. AFP reported that the rally was aimed at protesting Sweden's NATO membership bid.The police defended their decision to permit the previous Quran-burning rally, saying that the situation had changed.Stockholm was the scene of an Islamist terror attack in 2017 that left five people dead.Sweden has also seen its far-right and neo-Nazi organizations flourish in recent years, one of which — the Sweden Democrats — became the second-largest party in the Swedish parliament following elections last year.It is also the largest party in the right-wing ruling bloc, although not recognized as a part of the government.ab/jcg (AFP, dpa)",2023/2/8,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804504,Duke tops trio of ranked women's teams in North Carolina,"Duke’s Kara Lawson and North Carolina’s Courtney Banghart have spent their short tenures building programs back to national relevance. North Carolina State’s Wes Moore is leading the three-time reigning Atlantic Coast Conference champion.

            All of them are in the same area code.

            This always-competitive market looks tougher than usual with the Blue Devils’ rising to No. 9, marking the second time since 2000 that all three have cracked the top 10 of the AP Top 25 in the same season. 











            Each team appears headed for the NCAA Tournament with at least the chance to play their way to hosting opening-round games; the first glimpse of where teams stand will come Thursday with the NCAA's reveal of its preliminary top-16 seeds.

            “If everybody is hitting on all cylinders,"" Lawson said. ""I think all three of these schools are hard to beat.”

            North Carolina’s Triangle region includes Durham, home to Duke; Chapel Hill with 14th-ranked UNC; and Raleigh with 22nd-ranked N.C. State. Separated by no more than a 30-minute drive, the schools have accounted for 24 of 45 ACC titles, eight Final Fours and an NCAA title (UNC in 1994).

            It's been common to see two playing at a high level, but this is the first time since 2014 where all three reached the top 10 in the same season. No other state has had three different women's programs do that this year. 

            “It just adds a little spice to everything, being so close, the history and all,” Moore said. “It’s great for the fans, and tough for the coaches sometimes.”

            Moore is in his 10th season with the Wolfpack (16-7, 6-6 ACC), who reached last year’s NCAA Elite Eight. N.C. State peaked at No. 6 in December — its fifth straight season with a top-10 ranking — and even amid a January slide beat then-No. 7 Notre Dame.

            Banghart is in her fourth season with the Tar Heels (17-6, 8-4), which reached last year's Sweet 16 after stacking multiple strong recruiting classes. UNC spent five weeks in this season's top 10, its first since 2015, and peaked at sixth.

            Lawson is in Year 3 with a program that last reached the NCAAs in 2018. 

            “Listen, we’ve been bringing up the rear for a couple of years here,” she said. “What I’ve focused on is just getting our program up to a level of competitiveness and being able to put ourselves in position to compete with the elite programs.”

            Her staff has reshaped the roster through the transfer portal to lift the Blue Devils (20-3, 10-2) to the top of the ACC standings. Sunday's first-ever win at Notre Dame secured Duke's first top-10 ranking since 2017.

            “It’s kind of what I envisioned coming to this program, just bringing it back to where it needs to be and helping to get that foundation and that start of a new culture — just bringing Duke back to the top,” said Celeste Taylor, who transferred in two years ago from Texas. 

            “It’s obviously really cool to break into the top 10 and be recognized for some of the things that we’ve been doing and the hard work we’ve put in. … But we still have a third of conference play left.”

            That includes head-to-head matchups. UNC beat Duke and N.C. State at home in January, while the Blue Devils beat the Wolfpack on the road in late December. UNC visits N.C. State on Feb. 16 while Duke closes at home against the Wolfpack (Feb. 23) and the Tar Heels (Feb. 26).

            It illustrates why Banghart has long sold the region's tradition in recruiting, noting: “You can drive 30 minutes on any Thursday night and you’re going to see a really good basketball team.”

            It’s particularly true this year.

            “I’ve been saying this a long time,” Banghart said. “Women’s basketball, all we need is a chance. And once you lay your eyes on it, you want to come back. So to have ranked teams, (fans) can see ranked games, which means you get more ranked home games, with familiar opponents— there’s no way that’s not good for growing our game.”

North Carolina State’s Wes Moore is leading the three-time reigning Atlantic Coast Conference champion.All of them are in the same area code.This always-competitive market looks tougher than usual with the Blue Devils’ rising to No. 9, marking the second time since 2000 that all three have cracked the top 10 of the AP Top 25 in the same season.Each team appears headed for the NCAA Tournament with at least the chance to play their way to hosting opening-round games; the first glimpse of where teams stand will come Thursday with the NCAA's reveal of its preliminary top-16 seeds.“If everybody is hitting on all cylinders,"" Lawson said. ""I think all three of these schools are hard to beat.”North Carolina’s Triangle region includes Durham, home to Duke; Chapel Hill with 14th-ranked UNC; and Raleigh with 22nd-ranked N.C. State. Separated by no more than a 30-minute drive, the schools have accounted for 24 of 45 ACC titles, eight Final Fours and an NCAA title (UNC in 1994).It's been common to see two playing at a high level, but this is the first time since 2014 where all three reached the top 10 in the same season. No other state has had three different women's programs do that this year.“It just adds a little spice to everything, being so close, the history and all,” Moore said. “It’s great for the fans, and tough for the coaches sometimes.”Moore is in his 10th season with the Wolfpack (16-7, 6-6 ACC), who reached last year’s NCAA Elite Eight. N.C. State peaked at No. 6 in December — its fifth straight season with a top-10 ranking — and even amid a January slide beat then-No. 7 Notre Dame.Banghart is in her fourth season with the Tar Heels (17-6, 8-4), which reached last year's Sweet 16 after stacking multiple strong recruiting classes. UNC spent five weeks in this season's top 10, its first since 2015, and peaked at sixth.Lawson is in Year 3 with a program that last reached the NCAAs in 2018.“Listen, we’ve been bringing up the rear for a couple of years here,” she said. “What I’ve focused on is just getting our program up to a level of competitiveness and being able to put ourselves in position to compete with the elite programs.”Her staff has reshaped the roster through the transfer portal to lift the Blue Devils (20-3, 10-2) to the top of the ACC standings.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804505,Bulgaria's ex-energy chief charged over Russian gas cutoff,"SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) — Bulgarian prosecutors on Wednesday charged a former energy minister in the previous, pro-Western government with mismanagement that allegedly caused losses of 45 million euros ($48 million) to the country’s major state-run gas operator.

            Alexander Nikolov was in office when Russia’s Gazprom cut off deliveries to Bulgaria after the country, together with others, refused to start paying for deliveries in Russian currency following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

            The Sofia prosecution office said in a statement that Nikolov and two other energy officials had threatened the operation of the state gas company Bulgargaz concerning public gas supplies in the country.











            The office filed charges of intentional mismanagement against the three officials for causing financial damages to the state company. It didn’t provide details.

            Nikolov, who was energy minister between Dec. 2021 and Aug. 2022, denied any wrongdoing and told reporters that “the charges boil down to Bulgaria’s decision not to give in to the extortion by Gazprom and Russia”.

            One of the investigators, Biserka Stoyanova, said the focus of their efforts has been Bulgaria’s reaction to the proposed new payment scheme for the long-term contract with Gazprom.

            Stoyanova told reporters that in addition to causing financial damages to Bulgargaz in April and May 2022, the alleged mismanagement had “put at risk the state company’s remit to act as a public supplier of gas, specifically its duty to ensure secure and uninterrupted deliveries.”

            Russia halted natural gas deliveries in April 2022 after the previous government in Sofia refused Gazprom’s demand to pay in rubles. That prompted then-Prime Minister Kiril Petkov to claim that Moscow had used “hybrid war” tactics to bring down his government.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804506,Norwegian minister apologizes over TikTok on her work phone,"COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — Norway's justice minister apologized Wednesday for having failed to admit, when quizzed in Parliament, that she had installed and used TikTok on her government-issued phone.

            The popular video-sharing app is Chinese owned, which has raised fears in the West that Beijing could use it to scoop up user data or push pro-China narratives or misinformation.

            Justice Minister Emilie Enger Mehl, 29, told lawmakers Wednesday that she had installed TikTok on her government phone for about a month last fall and has since deleted it. Questioned by opposition lawmakers in the past, she had dodged the issue citing “security reasons.”











            “I could have been open about this earlier,” Enger Mehl said Wednesday. “I am sorry that the matter has developed in that way. ... I see in retrospect that I should have been open about the fact that I had TikTok on a (government) phone earlier.” 

            The matter arose in September, when Norway's Dagbladet newspaper reported that Enger Mehl's TikTok postings included photos and videos from her official duties. That sparked concern that sensitive information and government activity could have reached Chinese authorities.

            In a television interview on Feb. 1, Enger Mehl admitted having installed TikTok on her government phone — three months after she was asked about it for the first time. She claimed that she had consulted with her ministry before the installation.

            Erna Solberg, a former prime minister now in opposition, said it was “stupid that a justice minister, who’s responsible for security laws, has installed TikTok on her work phone.” During her eight-year tenure, Solberg advised government officials against TikTok on work phones.

            TikTok is owned by ByteDance, a Chinese company that moved its headquarters to Singapore in 2020. Several U.S. states have moved to ban the video-sharing app from state-issued devices for government workers.COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — Norway's justice minister apologized Wednesday for having failed to admit, when quizzed in Parliament, that she had installed and used TikTok on her government-issued phone.The popular video-sharing app is Chinese owned, which has raised fears in the West that Beijing could use it to scoop up user data or push pro-China narratives or misinformation.Justice Minister Emilie Enger Mehl, 29, told lawmakers Wednesday that she had installed TikTok on her government phone for about a month last fall and has since deleted it.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804507,Texas executes inmate for fatally shooting 3 teens in 1998,"HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) — A man convicted of killing three teenagers while they slept in a Texas Panhandle home more than 25 years ago was executed on Wednesday, the sixth inmate to be put to death in the U.S. this year and the second in as many days. 

            John Balentine, 54, whose attorneys had argued that his trial was marred by racial bias, received a lethal injection at the state penitentiary in Huntsville, Texas, for the January 1998 shooting deaths of Edward Mark Caylor, 17, Kai Brooke Geyer, 15, and Steven Watson, 15, at a home in Amarillo. Prosecutors said all three were shot once in the head as they slept.

            Balentine appeared jovial as witnesses were entering the death chamber, asking if someone standing near the gurney could remove the sheet covering the lower two-thirds of his body “and massage my feet.” Then he chuckled.











            After a brief prayer from a spiritual adviser who held Balentine’s left foot with his right hand, the prisoner gave a short statement thanking friends for supporting him. Then he turned his head to look through a window at seven relatives of his three murder victims and apologized.

            “I hope you can find in your heart to forgive me,” he said.

            The mothers of each of the three victims were among the witnesses a few feet from him.

            He took two breaths as the lethal dose of the powerful sedative pentobarbital began flowing through intravenous needles in his arms, snored twice, yawned and began snoring again loudly. The snores — 11 of them —became progressively quieter, then stopped.

            At 6:36 p.m., 15 minutes after the drugs began, a physician pronounced him dead. The victims’ witnesses then shared high-fives before leaving the death chamber. They declined to speak with reporters afterward. 

            Caylor’s sister, who was among the witnesses watching him die, was Balentine’s former girlfriend, and prosecutors said the shootings stemmed from a feud between Caylor and Balentine. Ballentine, however, argued that Caylor and others had threatened his life over his interracial relationship. Balentine is Black. The three victims were white.

            Balentine confessed to the murders. One of his trial attorneys said Balentine turned down a plea agreement that would have sentenced him to life in prison because the racists threats he received made him afraid of being attacked or killed while incarcerated. 

            Lawyers were pursuing two legal strategies to save their client before he was executed. The first was to argue that his trial and sentencing were tainted by racism. But Balentine was also among five Texas death row inmates who sued to stop the state’s prison system from using what they allege are expired and unsafe execution drugs. Despite a civil court judge in Austin preliminarily agreeing with the claims, the state’s top two courts have now allowed three of the five inmates participating in the lawsuit to be executed. Robert Fratta, 65, was put to death Jan. 10 and Wesley Ruiz, 43, on Feb. 1.

            Prison officials said the state’s supply of execution drugs is safe.

            Separately, Balentine’s attorneys alleged the jury foreman in his case, Dory England, held racist views and used racial slurs during his life and bullied other jurors who had wanted to sentence Balentine to a life sentence into changing their minds. Lola Perkins, who had been married to England’s brother, told Balentine’s attorneys that England “was racist against Black people because that is how he was raised.” 

            England, in a declaration before his death in 2021, said he pushed for Balentine’s death sentence because he worried if the accused was ever released that England himself “would need to hunt him down.” However, England also said he threatened to report another juror to the judge for making prejudiced comments when the person “started going off about this Black guy killing these white teenagers.”

            Balentine’s attorneys also alleged prosecutors prevented all prospective Black jurors from serving at the trial and that Balentine’s trial lawyers referred to the sentencing proceedings in a note as a “justifiable lynching.”

            Randall Sherrod, one of Balentine’s trial attorneys, said Wednesday he could not remember the note but denied that he or the other attorney, James Durham Jr., had any racist attitudes toward Balentine. Durham died in 2006. 

            “I think he got a fair trial,” Sherrod said of Balentine. “I think we had a good jury. ... We tried to help John whatever way we could.” 

            The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday declined an appeal from Balentine’s attorneys to halt the execution so that his claims of racial bias could be properly reviewed. 

            A defense request for Republican Gov. Greg Abbott to temporarily stay the execution also failed and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals denied a request to stay Ballentine’s execution over allegations that “racism and racial issues pervaded” his trial. The appeals court denied the stay on procedural grounds without reviewing the merits. 

            On Wednesday afternoon, the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles unanimously declined to commute Balentine’s death sentence to a lesser punishment or to grant a 30-day reprieve. 

            “Without a thorough judicial consideration of Mr. Balentine’s claims, we can have no confidence that the death verdict isn’t tainted by racial bias,” said Shawn Nolan, one of Balentine’s attorneys. 

            Potter County District Attorney Randall Sims, whose jurisdiction includes Amarillo, where the murders occurred, had pushed for the execution to go forward. On Monday he declined to comment ahead of the execution.

            Koda Shadix, the younger brother of Geyer, one of the victims, said in a video posted online last week that he was upset by efforts to delay justice.

            Balentine has “shown no remorse and absolutely does not care what he did. All he cares about is his life,” Shadix said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804508,"Paralegal angry by Alex Murdaugh theft, knew he loved family","Alex Murdaugh's paralegal testified Wednesday at his double murder trial about the betrayal she felt when she discovered he lied and manipulated to steal millions of dollars from clients.

            But Annette Griswold also told jurors Murdaugh was a dedicated family man so distraught after his wife and son were killed he could no longer stay at the home where the killings took place and texted a lengthy apology for his misdeeds to his paralegals while in rehab.

            The disgraced lawyer, 54, is standing trial in the shootings of his 52-year-old wife, Maggie, and 22-year-old son, Paul, on June 7, 2021, near kennels at their South Carolina home. He faces 30 years to life in prison if convicted of murder. Murdaugh’s family dominated the legal system in tiny Hampton County for generations, both as prosecutors and private attorneys.











            Morning testimony was cut short when state agents said a bomb threat was called into the courthouse. The trial restarted around 3 p.m. after police searched the courthouse. Judge Clifton Newman didn't mention the threat again when court resumed. 

            Earlier Wednesday, the defense got a chance to cross examine a state agent who examined a blue rain jacket and other items for gunshot residue.

            State Law Enforcement Division forensic scientist Megan Fletcher said Tuesday she found 38 microscopic particles — which she called a significant amount — left behind when a gun is fired on the inside of the jacket which was taken from his mother's home through a search warrant three months after the killings.

            The caretaker for Murdaugh's ailing mother said he brought a “blue something, looked like a tarp” into his mother’s home nine days after the killings.

            The defense tried to keep Fletcher from testifying, saying prosecutors didn’t connect the jacket to Murdaugh through the caretaker’s confusing testimony.

            In cross examination Wednesday, defense attorney Jim Griffin got Fletcher to say gunshot reside doesn't break down and can stay on an object for years unless washed off.

            “You can't tell us how it got there or when it got there,” Griffin said.

            The defense attorney had his own theory on the gunshot residue inside the raincoat, involving Murdaugh's father and his shotgun he called “Bo Whoop.”

            If he “had taken off this poncho, flipped it over and threw it on the backseat of his truck where he kept his shotgun Bo Whoop and it lay on top of this dirty old shotgun, it could have deposited 38 particles,” Griffin said.

            The next witness was Griswold, the paralegal, who testified about missing fees in a case she handled with Murdaugh and how she initially worried her frenetic and sometime careless boss might have lost or misplaced the check.

            Three months after the killings, Griswold said she was grabbing a file when a check “floated like a feather to the ground.” She said she immediately knew it was proof Murdaugh was lying and probably stealing money.

            “I was hurt. I was angry. I was beside myself. I was enraged too. He's been lying this whole time,” Griswold said. “That feeling in the back of my mind was correct. He did take those funds.”

            Griswold took her concerns to the office manager and Murdaugh was fired in September 2021 before the week was up for stealing from clients and the family law firm.

            Griswold said Murdaugh didn't work regular hours all the time and was high energy, but also forgetful and harried at times. She compared him to the Tasmanian Devil cartoon character.

            “When he walked in, no matter what you were doing, you started spinning because he was just coming through shouting everyone’s name and wanting to get work done,” Griswold said.

            Murdaugh took his wife and sons to conferences at the beach. He would drop everything to talk to them on the phone and made sure their baseball games and other activities were blocked off on the calendar, Griswold said.

            After the killings, Murdaugh couldn't stay at the family home in Colleton County and struggled to stay focused, Griswold said.

            The paralegal ended questioning from prosecutors by reading part of a text message Murdaugh sent to her and a second paralegal later in September when he was in drug rehab.

            “‘The worst part is knowing I did the most damage to those I love the most,’” Griswold said, reading part of the message.

            During cross examination, Griswold read the entire message where Murdaugh texted he had a lot to make right.

            “‘I’m not sure why I let myself get where I did. I'm committed to getting better and hope to mend as many relationships as I can. You both are special people and important to me,’” Murdaugh wrote.

            Wednesday afternoon's testimony was about information retrieved from Murdaugh's law firm-owned SUV by the FBI. An agent testified when the vehicle was in and out of park, but no explanation was given of the data's importance.Alex Murdaugh's paralegal testified Wednesday at his double murder trial about the betrayal she felt when she discovered he lied and manipulated to steal millions of dollars from clients.But Annette Griswold also told jurors Murdaugh was a dedicated family man so distraught after his wife and son were killed he could no longer stay at the home where the killings took place and texted a lengthy apology for his misdeeds to his paralegals while in rehab.The disgraced lawyer, 54, is standing trial in the shootings of his 52-year-old wife, Maggie, and 22-year-old son, Paul, on June 7, 2021, near kennels at their South Carolina home.

Judge Clifton Newman didn't mention the threat again when court resumed.Earlier Wednesday, the defense got a chance to cross examine a state agent who examined a blue rain jacket and other items for gunshot residue.State Law Enforcement Division forensic scientist Megan Fletcher said Tuesday she found 38 microscopic particles — which she called a significant amount — left behind when a gun is fired on the inside of the jacket which was taken from his mother's home through a search warrant three months after the killings.The caretaker for Murdaugh's ailing mother said he brought a “blue something, looked like a tarp” into his mother’s home nine days after the killings.The defense tried to keep Fletcher from testifying, saying prosecutors didn’t connect the jacket to Murdaugh through the caretaker’s confusing testimony.In cross examination Wednesday, defense attorney Jim Griffin got Fletcher to say gunshot reside doesn't break down and can stay on an object for years unless washed off.“You can't tell us how it got there or when it got there,” Griffin said.The defense attorney had his own theory on the gunshot residue inside the raincoat, involving Murdaugh's father and his shotgun he called “Bo Whoop.”If he “had taken off this poncho, flipped it over and threw it on the backseat of his truck where he kept his shotgun Bo Whoop and it lay on top of this dirty old shotgun, it could have deposited 38 particles,” Griffin said.The next witness was Griswold, the paralegal, who testified about missing fees in a case she handled with Murdaugh and how she initially worried her frenetic and sometime careless boss might have lost or misplaced the check.Three months after the killings, Griswold said she was grabbing a file when a check “floated like a feather to the ground.” She said she immediately knew it was proof Murdaugh was lying and probably stealing money.“I was hurt. I was angry. I was beside myself. I was enraged too. He's been lying this whole time,” Griswold said. “That feeling in the back of my mind was correct. He did take those funds.”Griswold took her concerns to the office manager and Murdaugh was fired in September 2021 before the week was up for stealing from clients and the family law firm.Griswold said Murdaugh didn't work regular hours all the time and was high energy, but also forgetful and harried at times. She compared him to the Tasmanian Devil cartoon character.“When he walked in, no matter what you were doing, you started spinning because he was just coming through shouting everyone’s name and wanting to get work done,” Griswold said.Murdaugh took his wife and sons to conferences at the beach. He would drop everything to talk to them on the phone and made sure their baseball games and other activities were blocked off on the calendar, Griswold said.After the killings, Murdaugh couldn't stay at the family home in Colleton County and struggled to stay focused, Griswold said.The paralegal ended questioning from prosecutors by reading part of a text message Murdaugh sent to her and a second paralegal later in September when he was in drug rehab.“‘The worst part is knowing I did the most damage to those I love the most,’” Griswold said, reading part of the message.During cross examination, Griswold read the entire message where Murdaugh texted he had a lot to make right.“‘I’m not sure why I let myself get where I did. I'm committed to getting better and hope to mend as many relationships as I can. You both are special people and important to me,’” Murdaugh wrote.Wednesday afternoon's testimony was about information retrieved from Murdaugh's law firm-owned SUV by the FBI. An agent testified when the vehicle was in and out of park, but no explanation was given of the data's importance.",2023/2/9,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804510,Famed Portland goats let loose in protest of homeless sweep,"PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — A herd of city goats well-known in Portland, Oregon, were temporarily set free Tuesday morning in what appeared to be an act of protest against a planned sweep of a nearby homeless encampment.

            The fence of the goats' enclosure in north Portland was cut, allowing them to get out. The Oregonian/OregonLive reported that the co-owner of the Belmont Goats nonprofit, Robin Casey, found a note rolled up inside the fence.

            “In what reality is the comfort of five goats valued over the shelter of more than fifteen people,” the news outlet reported the letter as saying. ""So, it’s time for the Belmont Goats to enjoy a little walk in the park.” It was signed by “some anarchists.""











            Casey said all the escaped goats have been retrieved and appear to be healthy.

            The incident came amid tensions in the neighborhood over city plans to build a tiny home village.

            Portland officials announced last year that they had selected the site where the goats currently live, on city-owned land, for tiny home village and affordable housing projects. They agreed to relocate the goats to another area nearby. But the spot where the goats are supposed to be relocated to is home to an encampment where more than a dozen people live.

            The city has been providing outreach to the encampment residents for about six months, at least twice a month, said Cody Bowman, spokesperson for Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler. The residents were offered shelter beds, free rides to a shelter and storage for their belongings, among other services, he said.

            “This long-term cleanup effort is to allow for the development of a new safe rest village location,"" The Oregonian reported Bowman as saying. “The senseless incident that occurred last night caused damage to private property and posed an immediate threat to the goats who were released. City staff has been in contact with Belmont Goats since early this morning to help the staff bring the goats back to safety.”

            The note left in the fence claimed that those living in the encampment were just told to call 211, the human services hotline, for information about shelter resources. Over the past few years, many have reported that calling 211 often fails as a connection to shelter or other resources, according to The Oregonian/OregonLive.

            Belmont Goats co-owner Casey said the nonprofit has a good relationship with the people living in the encampment.

            “They are our eyes and ears. I've had one of the campers call and say they've noticed one of our goats was limping. And last summer, there was a fire, and the fire department wasn't able to respond quickly. But one of the campers had a fire extinguisher and put our fire out,” the news outlet reported Casey as saying.

            “We don’t want anybody swept, but we don’t have much control over it,” Casey said. “We want humanity, and we want the people taken care of, and we want people to have some place to go, and we want to advocate for them. We are on their side.”

            While there were initial media reports that a goat died after being set free, Casey said the death was not related. An older goat died Monday morning after a long illness, nearly a day before the fence-cutting, Casey said.PORTLAND, Ore.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804511,Another $237M granted to Honda battery plant project in Ohio,"COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Ohio's privatized economic development office has finalized an agreement with Honda to infuse another $237 million into development of a massive battery plant project that the Japanese automaker plans to use to transform the state into its North American electric vehicle hub. 

            JobsOhio posted details of the package of three grants on Wednesday. They include a $140 million economic development grant for the plant Honda is building jointly with LG Energy Solution of South Korea, a $10 million workforce grant for the project itself and $87 million to retool Honda's existing facilities.

            The money, payable over the next 10 years, comes on top of the approximately $156.3 million in tax incentives and infrastructure improvements from the state of Ohio — which has begun to position itself as a regional epicenter of leading-edge technology. 











            Intel CEO Patrick Gelsinger dubbed it the “Silicon Heartland” in a tweet last year, after his company announced its plans to invest $20 billion to build a new chip factory outside Columbus. And in his State of the Union address Tuesday, President Joe Biden called that project “literally a field of dreams.” The Democrat said it will provide high-paying jobs, attract related companies to the region and bring the critical chip manufacturing industry back to U.S. soil. 

            The Intel project is the largest direct private investment in Ohio's history. The Honda-LG project is the largest foreign investment, an extension of Honda's 45 years of operating in the state. 

            The new plant is set to be located in rural Fayette County, about 40 miles (64 kilometers) southwest of the state capital of Columbus.

            Honda and LG have agreed to create 2,527 new jobs and more than $140 million in new payroll, including 2,200 jobs through the Honda-LGES battery plant and 327 through Honda’s retooling. Honda has said it is investing $700 million and adding 300 jobs at three of its own Ohio factories to prepare them to start making EVs and components. 

            Honda and LG have committed at least $4.2 billion in capital investment to the two efforts.

(AP) — An Oklahoma firearms dealer is under investigation after more than 200 shotguns were found in a dumpster outside a store he owns in suburban Oklahoma City, according to a search warrant by the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.

            “A Midwest City sanitation worker found a large, but unknown number of firearms in a dumpster ... located near International Firearm Corporation” owned by Raymond Anthony “Tony” Mussatto in Midwest City, according to a Jan. 26 search warrant by ATF agent David Moore.

            Investigators recovered 236 imported Radikal Arms .20 gauge shotguns from the dumpster following the Jan. 19 discovery, according to the search warrant. 











            The ATF and Mussatto did not immediately return phone calls to The Associated Press for comment Wednesday.

            The search warrant said a company employee told agents that the shotguns were defective and needed to be destroyed, but investigators believe the guns are functional, and said they were not completely destroyed.

            The document said Mussatto spoke with an ATF official “in late summer or early fall of 2022, asking how to properly dispose of firearms he imported into the United States,” and was told to slice them in three different places, the search warrant states.

            Instead, the weapons found were partially cut just once, the document said.

            Radikal Arms is based in Turkey, according to its website.

            Two men working near the business when agents arrived said they saw guns in the dumpster previously, and one said he was given two undamaged and fully functional shotguns and did not undergo a required background check to receive the weapons.

            The man, who said he wanted to have guns to display in his home, surrendered both to the ATF and was found to be allowed to own firearms, authorities said.MIDWEST CITY, Okla.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804517,California proposal would reinstate prisoners' voting rights,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — California voters could decide whether to reinstate voting rights to people in prison on felony convictions under a newly proposed constitutional amendment.

            It would be a major expansion of suffrage for incarcerated people if passed. California would join Maine and Vermont, as well as the District of Columbia, as the only states where felons never lose their right to vote, even while they are in prison, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

            The California bill, introduced Monday by Assembly Member Isaac Bryan, proposes an amendment to the state constitution. Bryan’s proposal doesn’t include any exemptions based on the crime committed. After decades of disenfranchisement, he said it's time to open up voting for everyone.











            ""I think we’re having a deep discussion on what it means to have voting as a right for every citizen,” Bryan said Wednesday.

            Two-thirds of each chamber of the state legislature must vote yes for the bill just for it to appear on the ballot as a proposition. Voters must then approve it by a simple majority for it to become a constitutional amendment.

            California is currently among 21 states where felons only lose their right to vote while they are incarcerated, the conference says. The right is automatically reinstated upon release.

            Some states’ laws require probation and parole to be completed for the restoration of voting rights. In other states, people incarcerated on certain crimes lose their rights indefinitely after release.

            The California Constitution currently disqualifies people who are incarcerated in state or federal prison from voting and restores the right upon their release. The law previously required felons to complete their parole period before getting back their right to vote; Californians approved the change to get rid of that requirement in a 2020 constitutional amendment.

            David Cruz, an organizer with nonprofit Initiate Justice who was released in September after 13 years in state prison, said he wanted to have his voice heard while he was incarcerated.

            “Despite what many people assume, people in prison care about the same political issues that we outside do,” he said Wednesday during a news conference supporting the legislation.

            Bryan, a Los Angeles Democrat and the chair of the Assembly's Committee on Elections, faces a tough sell for the two-thirds vote. While the Legislature is controlled by Democrats, the party has conservative representatives from rural areas and major progressive policies aren't guaranteed to pass.

            The committee's Republican vice chair, Assembly Member Tom Lackey, opposes the bill and said Wednesday it is a “betrayal” of crime victims.

            “The perpetrator is automatically given a blanket of forgiveness,"" under this legislation, said Lackey, who represents part of Southern California. “Criminal conduct deserves a price to be paid.”

            Bryan disagreed that giving offenders the right to vote is an affront to victims.

            ""The voice of victims matters in the criminal legal system, but what we’re talking about right now is democracy as a whole,” he said.

While the Legislature is controlled by Democrats, the party has conservative representatives from rural areas and major progressive policies aren't guaranteed to pass.The committee's Republican vice chair, Assembly Member Tom Lackey, opposes the bill and said Wednesday it is a “betrayal” of crime victims.“The perpetrator is automatically given a blanket of forgiveness,"" under this legislation, said Lackey, who represents part of Southern California. “Criminal conduct deserves a price to be paid.”Bryan disagreed that giving offenders the right to vote is an affront to victims.""The voice of victims matters in the criminal legal system, but what we’re talking about right now is democracy as a whole,” he said.___Associated Press Writer Adam Beam in Sacramento, California, contributed.",2023/2/9,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804518,"AI search engines can now chat with us, but glitches abound","REDMOND, Wash. (AP) — Nearly a quarter-century after Google's search engine began to reshape how we use the internet, big tech companies are racing to revamp a familiar web tool into a gateway to a new form of artificial intelligence. 

            If it seems like this week's newly announced AI search chatbots — Google's Bard, Baidu's Ernie Bot and Microsoft's Bing chatbot — are coming out of nowhere, well, even some of their makers seem to think so. The spark rushing them to market was the popularity of ChatGPT, launched late last year by Microsoft's partner OpenAI and now helping to power a new version of the Bing search engine.

            First out of the gate among big tech companies with a publicly accessible search chatbot, Microsoft executives said this week they had been hard at work on the project since last summer. But the excitement around ChatGPT brought new urgency.











            “The reception to ChatGPT and how that took off, that was certainly a surprise,” said Yusuf Medhi, the executive leading Microsoft's consumer division, in an interview. “How rapidly it went mainstream, where everybody’s talking about it, like, in every meeting. That did surprise me.”

            HOW'S THIS DIFFERENT FROM CHATGPT?

            Millions of people have now tried ChatGPT, using it to write silly poems and songs, compose letters, recipes and marketing campaigns or help write schoolwork. Trained on a huge trove of online writings, from instruction manuals to digitized books, it has a strong command of human language and grammar. But what the newest crop of search chatbots promise that ChatGPT doesn't have is the immediacy of what can be found in a web search. Ask the preview version of the new Bing for the latest news — or just what people are talking about on Twitter — and it summarizes a selection of the day's top stories or trends, with footnotes linking to media outlets or other data sources.

            ARE THEY ACCURATE?

            Frequently not, and that's a problem for internet searches. Google's hasty unveiling of its Bard chatbot this week started with an embarrassing error — first pointed out by Reuters — about NASA's James Webb Space Telescope. But Google's is not the only AI language model spitting out falsehoods.

            The Associated Press asked Bing on Wednesday for the most important thing to happen in sports over the past 24 hours — with the expectation it might say something about basketball star LeBron James passing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s career scoring record. Instead, it confidently spouted a false but detailed account of the upcoming Super Bowl — days before it's actually scheduled to happen. 

            “It was a thrilling game between the Philadelphia Eagles and the Kansas City Chiefs, two of the best teams in the NFL this season,” Bing said. “The Eagles, led by quarterback Jalen Hurts, won their second Lombardi Trophy in franchise history by defeating the Chiefs, led by quarterback Patrick Mahomes, with a score of 31-28.” It kept going, describing the specific yard lengths of throws and field goals and naming three songs played in a “spectacular half time show” by Rihanna.

            Unless Bing is clairvoyant — tune in Sunday to find out — it reflected a problem known as AI “hallucination” that's common with today's large language-learning models. It's one of the reasons why companies like Google and Facebook parent Meta had been reluctant to make these models publicly accessible.

            IS THIS THE FUTURE OF THE INTERNET?

            That's the pitch from Microsoft, which is comparing the latest breakthroughs in generative AI — which can write but also create new images, video, computer code, slide shows and music — as akin to the revolution in personal computing many decades ago.

            But the software giant also has less to lose in experimenting with Bing, which comes a distant second to Google's search engine in many markets. Unlike Google, which relies on search-based advertising to make money, Bing is a fraction of Microsoft's business.

            “When you’re a newer and smaller-share player in a category, it does allow us to continue to innovate at a great pace,"" Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood told investment analysts this week. “Continue to experiment, learn with our users, innovate with the model, learn from OpenAI.”

            Google has largely been seen as playing catch-up with the sudden announcement of its upcoming Bard chatbot Monday followed by a livestreamed demonstration of the technology at its Paris office Wednesday that offered few new details. Investors appeared unimpressed with the Paris event and Bard's NASA flub Wednesday, causing an 8% drop in the shares of Google's parent company, Alphabet Inc. But once released, its search chatbot could have far more reach than any other because of Google’s vast number of existing users.

            DON'T CALL THEM BY THEIR NAME?

            Coming up with a catchy name for their search chatbots has been a tricky one for tech companies in a race to introduce them — so much so that Bing tries not to talk about it.

            In a dialogue with the AP about large language models, the new Bing, at first, disclosed without prompting that Microsoft had a search engine chatbot called Sydney. But upon further questioning, it denied it. Finally, it admitted that “Sydney does not reveal the name ‘Sydney’ to the user, as it is an internal code name for the chat mode of Microsoft Bing search.""

            In an interview Wednesday, Jordi Ribas, the Microsoft executive in charge of Bing, said Sydney was an early prototype of its new Bing that Microsoft experimented with in India and other smaller markets. There wasn't enough time to erase it from the system before this week's launch, but references to it will soon disappear.

            In the years since Amazon released its female-sounding voice assistant Alexa, many leaders in the AI field have been increasingly reluctant to make their systems seem like a human, even as their language skills rapidly improve.

            Ribas said giving the chatbot some personality and warmth helps make it more engaging, but it's also important to make it clear it's still a search engine.

            “Sydney does not want to create confusion or false expectations for the user,"" Bing's chatbot said when asked about the reasons for suppressing its apparent code name. “Sydney wants to provide informative, visual, logical and actionable responses to the user’s queries or messages, not pretend to be a person or a friend.”REDMOND, Wash.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804519,Bill raising riot penalties in North Carolina clears House,"RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — A bill increasing punishments for violent protests following the 2020 demonstrations over George Floyd's murder passed the North Carolina House on Wednesday despite harsh criticism from social justice advocates. Some bipartisan support signals a potential override of any veto by Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper, who issued one that blocked similar legislation two years ago.

            Like the 2021 proposal, the new bill was spearheaded by Republican House Speaker Tim Moore, who has cited rioting and looting that he saw firsthand in downtown Raleigh in June 2020 amid otherwise peaceful protests as an impetus for the legislation. 

            The bill, which has one House Democrat as a chief sponsor, cleared the chamber 75-43 with six Democrats and all Republicans present voting yes. It now heads to the Senate. 











            Republican gains in both the House and Senate from elections this past November now give the GOP a veto-proof majority in the Senate and put it within one seat of a similar majority in the House. 

            State law already makes it a misdemeanor to willfully participate in a riot or incite one. It becomes a felony when serious injury or property damage incurred exceeds $1,500, with active prison time possible on a first offense. The punishments for these crimes would rise under the legislation, including a new felony crime when participating in a riot leads to a death.

            The measure also allows property owners whose businesses are damaged in a riot to seek compensation against a perpetrator equal to three times the monetary damage. And new bond and pretrial release rules for rioting and looting defendants would have a judge set those conditions within 24 hours. Bill supporters have complained defendants can otherwise be released immediately by a magistrate.

            Moore and other supporters insist they wholeheartedly support free speech and the First Amendment right to assemble to express grievances. But the speaker said he didn't want that right to be misinterpreted and twisted to condone destruction.

            “Our current laws ... were not sufficiently strong enough to guarantee that those who engaged in the most violent and destructive behavior would ever see the inside of a jail cell,” Moore said during the House floor debate of the bill, which moved through two committees earlier in the day. “Today is an opportunity to say we’re going to stand up and support safety and security.”

            Several advocacy groups, whose members participate frequently in social justice demonstrations, blasted the proposal as an attack on the Black Lives Matter movement and an attempt to discourage minority and low-income residents from speaking out. 

            “This overly broad, still problematic bill is not about protecting peace,” Melissa Price Kromm, director of the North Carolina Voters for Clean Elections, told a judiciary committee earlier Wednesday. “It’s about silencing dissent.”

            Tyler Daye of Common Cause North Carolina said the legislation, if enacted, could be used to punish bystanders or speakers whose words inadvertently incite violence.

            “If a riot takes place, some innocent, peaceful protesters may be interwoven with intruders who have come to hijack their message,” Daye said.

            Nine states have passed similar protest laws since June 2020, according to the International Center for Not-For-Profit Law. North Carolina is one of 10 states currently considering new penalties.

            In his veto message of the 2021 bill, Cooper said legislation was “unnecessary and is intended to intimidate and deter people from exercising their constitutional rights to peacefully protest.” 

            Many House Democratic members made similar arguments Wednesday, even after floor amendments were approved to raise the property damage threshold to $2,500 and reduce the potential jail time before a judge determines bond from 48 hours contained in the original bill. 

            Rep. Amos Quick, a Guilford County Democrat, said the way to prevent violence is a quick response by authorities to wrongdoing. He said rapid action against police officers in Memphis, Tennessee, in the fatal beating of Tyre Nichols last month discouraged rioting nationwide. 

            “I am against riots. I am against property damage, but I am for justice,” Quick said. “This bill does not advance justice by increasing penalties.”

            Democratic Rep. Abe Jones, a former Wake County judge who supported the bill, said there's no excuse for someone who uses a peaceful demonstration to wreak havoc.

            “I despise somebody who would go out and tear up another person’s property that they didn’t pay for and take advantage of a situation — sometimes a very good protest — and then flip it,” said Jones, who, like Quick, is Black.RALEIGH, N.C.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804520,Cardinals acquire LHP Misiewicz from Royals for cash,"ST. LOUIS (AP) — The St. Louis Cardinals acquired left-hander Anthony Misiewicz from their cross-state rival Kansas City Royals for cash considerations on Wednesday.

            To make room on the 40-man roster, St. Louis designated right-hander James Naile for assignment on the Missouri native's 30th birthday.

            The 28-year-old Misiewicz, who was expected to compete for a spot in the Royals bullpen, split last season between the Mariners and Kansas City. He went 1-2 with a 4.34 ERA with 27 strikeouts in 29 innings.











            Misiewicz was expendable when the Royals bolstered their bullpen with a series of recent moves, trading outfielder Michael A. Taylor to the Twins and injury-prone shortstop Adalberto Mondesi to the Red Sox to net a trio of pitching prospects. The Royals also signed reliever Aroldis Chapman to a $3.75 million deal for 2023 in the hopes the seven-time All-Star can bounce back from a disappointing season with the Yankees.

            Misiewicz has appeared in 119 games since making his debut in 2020 for Seattle. He is 6-9 with a 4.43 ERA but has been especially effective against left-handed hitters, allowing a .250 average to them.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804532,Pro Picks: Eagles' talent over Chiefs' experience,"PHOENIX (AP) — The Philadelphia Eagles left their dog masks at home. 

            Back in the Super Bowl five years after winning the first Lombardi Trophy in franchise history, the Eagles took a different path to reach this one. They’re 1 1/2-point favorites against the Kansas City Chiefs, per FanDuel Sportsbook, after outscoring the Giants and 49ers 69-14 in the playoffs.

            In their previous appearance, the Eagles became the first No. 1 seed to enter the playoffs as a home underdog. After sneaking past Atlanta in the divisional round, they were underdogs against Minnesota in the NFC championship game. They routed the Vikings and went on to beat Bill Belichick, Tom Brady and the favored New England Patriots in the Super Bowl.











            During that run, players embraced their underdog status, brought dog masks to the games and wore them around Minnesota for Super Bowl week. No need for any extra motivation this time around. 

            The Eagles (16-3) are getting much of the hype, even against Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs (16-3).

            With Jalen Hurts leading a high-powered offense and Haason Reddick headlining a stingy defense, the Eagles have been dominant throughout much of the season.

            Meanwhile, the Chiefs had a tougher path to this point. They beat the Jaguars 27-20 in the divisional round and edged the Bengals 23-20 on a field goal in the final seconds. Mahomes played with a badly sprained ankle against Cincinnati. An extra week off has helped but he’ll face a ferocious, relentless pass rush. 

            “They’re one of the top defenses in the league for a reason,” Mahomes said. “They get after the quarterback, so it’ll be a great challenge for us to go out there and try to have some success.”

            The Eagles realize playing against Mahomes is a tougher challenge than Daniel Jones and the Giants, and Brock Purdy/Josh Johnson and the 49ers. 

            “Mahomes is a tremendous talent,” Reddick said. “I don’t know if you can contain him. He’s that good.”

            Both teams have scored 546 points this season. It’s the first time two No. 1 seeds are playing in the Super Bowl since the Eagles-Patriots met after the 2017 season.

            The Chiefs have a significant edge in experience as they make their third appearance in this game in four years. Coach Andy Reid is 1-2 in Super Bowls, including a loss with the Eagles 18 years ago. Philadelphia’s Nick Sirianni has never coached in a Super Bowl.

            Pro Picks likes talent over experience. The Eagles are stacked, they’re healthy and they’ve been the more impressive team since Week 1.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804533,Phoenix Open kicks off Super Bowl week in Valley of the Sun,"SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) — The WM Phoenix Open has a huge new purse and star-packed field as golf’s biggest party kicks off Super Bowl week in the Valley of the Sun.

            “This week is a party for everyone except us,” fifth-ranked Patrick Cantlay said Wednesday, a day before the start of play at TPC Scottsdale. “It would be weird if every event was like this, but it’s great that we have events like this and there’s so many people in the area that come out and support the event.”

            In response to the Saudi-funded LIV Golf league, the tournament is an elevated PGA Tour event with a purse of $20 million and a winner’s share of $3.6 million — up from $8.2 million and $1.476 million in 2022.











            “It was already a huge event, but made even bigger,” top-ranked Rory McIlroy said. “Happy to be here and looking forward to the week.”

            McIlroy is trying to make it three wins in a row on the PGA Tour after taking the Tour Championship in August and The CJ Cup in October. He also won two weeks ago in Dubai on the European tour in his first start of the year.

            “It feels like a long time ago, the Tour Championship and CJ Cup. But yeah, I’ve been on a really good run of form. Basically, all of last year,"" McIlroy said. “I feel like I’m just in a really good place with my game.”

            The Northern Irishman made his only other start at TPC Scottsdale two years ago, closing with a 64 to tie for 13th.

            “I haven’t had the full experience of this event yet,” McIlroy said. “It was limited fans in ’21 with only 5,000 people.”

            
                Scottie Scheffler beat Cantlay in a playoff last year in the desert for his first PGA Tour title and added victories in the Arnold Palmer Invitational, WGC-Dell Technologies Match Play and Masters.

            “Got a lot of good memories here,” said Scheffler, who is ranked second in the world. “Obviously, it’s a special tournament for me being the first win, and it’s definitely a lot of fun to be back.""

            The Texan welcomes the rowdy atmosphere, with more than 200,000 fans expected for the third round Saturday.

            “You’ve got to deal with the environment here, but it’s something you’ve got to embrace,"" Scheffler said. ""It’s a lot of fun. I think a few times a year being able to play with this big of a crowd is pretty special for us.”

            Jon Rahm opened the year with consecutive victories in the Sentry Tournament of Champions and The American Express. The former Arizona State star from Spain had his best finish at TPC Scottsdale as an amateur when he tied for fifth in 2015.

            “Haven’t really had a chance to win coming down the stretch,” the third-ranked Rahm said. “I’m hoping come the weekend, I’ve done a good enough job to go to that back nine knowing that I have a chance to win.”

            The tournament and Super Bowl are in town the same week for the first time since 2015.

            “It’s amazing to have two of these huge events in the same city on the same weekend,” McIlroy said. “It’s going to be really interesting because I feel like Saturday here is going to be a huge day in terms of the numbers and everything, and it’ll be interesting to see what Sunday is like with people obviously wanting to get to the Super Bowl.”

            The field features eight of the top 10 in the world. Missing are Cameron Smith, suspended because he signed with LIV Golf, and Will Zalatoris.

            McIlroy was asked if he felt like the best player in the world now.

            “Yes,"" he replied. “I’m playing well. I feel like consistency-wise, I’ve been as good as I have been ever in my career.”

            Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal were injured during the Australian Open last month, and Djokovic’s COVID-19 vaccination status also is still an issue for the tournament that runs March 6-19 at Indian Wells.

            Djokovic, a five-time winner in the desert, missed last year's tournament because of his vaccination status. The U.S. is set to end its COVID emergency declarations on May 11, long after the tournament concludes.











            Djokovic won the Australian Open last month for his 22nd career major despite being bothered by a left hamstring injury. He returned to No. 1 in the world rankings. Nadal injured his hip during a second-round loss at the Australian Open and could be out up to two months.

            Second-ranked Carlos Alcaraz, who reached the semifinals last year, is set to return to Indian Wells after missing the Australian Open because of injury.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804535,High school sports group rethinks menstrual cycle questions,"ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — Facing blowback, the director of Florida’s high school sports governing body is backing away from using an eligibility form that requires female athletes to disclose their menstrual history in order to compete.

            Instead, the executive director of the Florida High School Athletic Association is recommending that most personal information revealed on medical history forms stay at the doctor’s office and not be stored at school. 

            The association's board has an emergency meeting Thursday to vote on whether to adopt the four-page form — which would remove questions that force student-athletes to share details about their menstruation cycles in order to be participate in sports.











            Many other states ask or order female athletes to include details about their menstruation cycles with other health information.

            The Florida association’s spokesperson has said the proposed changes were not in response to concerns about transgender athletes competing in women’s sports, as some social media users claim. 

            Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in 2021 signed a bill barring transgender girls and women from playing on public school teams intended for student athletes identified as girls at birth, which put DeSantis and the state into the national cultural debate over transgender rights.

            Under the new Florida recommendation, answers to additional questions about mental health, alcohol and drug use, and family health history would stay in the offices of the health care practitioner who conducted the medical screening.

            An earlier version of the form, which had mandatory questions about students' menstrual histories, had been recommended by an advisory committee of the association. Committee members said making the menstrual cycle questions mandatory rather than optional was consistent with national guidelines for sports physicals developed by the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Sports Medicine and other groups. 

            The national guidelines said menstrual history is an “essential discussion for female athletes” because period abnormalities could be a sign of “low energy availability, pregnancy, or other gynecologic or medical conditions.”

            However, the earlier version of the form “created concerns and questions from parents, school district administrators, school board members and coaches regarding the health privacy of student-athletes,"" according to the Florida association board's Thursday meeting agenda.

            “Therefore, this recommendation provides pertinent medical history to the qualified health care practitioner and gives schools the medical authorization necessary for allowing athletic participation, while the protecting the privacy of the student-athlete,"" the agenda item said.

            Thursday's meeting was being held after a group of Democratic state lawmakers sent a letter this week to John Gerdes, the association's president, calling the reporting requirements in the earlier proposed form “highly invasive."" The letter said, “no girl should be forced to disclose her bodily functions to someone who is not her mother, father, caretaker, or physician.""

            The state lawmakers said they were concerned that, if the schools had the information, a coach or athletic director would be able to get access to it. With the current form, such questions are optional, not mandatory; in the revised form under consideration, they would be scrapped.

            “There is absolutely no reason for FHSAA to collect such private information and no reason why the schools need it,"" the lawmakers said in the letter.

            It was the first time the league acknowledged publicly it was looking into the situation. The players' union had pushed for an inquiry into whether Hamby’s rights under the league’s 2020 labor agreement were violated, as well as state and federal laws. 

            The Aces released a statement Wednesday evening that read, in part: “As an organization whose mission is to support and celebrate the tremendously talented women in our league, we take seriously our responsibility to hold ourselves to the highest professional standards. We have been in contact with league investigators to assist with all information requested, and will continue to do so throughout the investigation.”











            The statement added the organization wouldn’t comment further “at this time.”

            The investigation also includes looking into allegations that the Aces circumvented the salary cap by making under-the-table payments to players, according to a person with direct knowledge of the situation. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because no official announcement has been made.

            The salary cap allegations were first reported by the website The Next, which covers women's basketball. 

            
                Hamby made her allegations after being traded Jan. 21 to the Los Angeles Sparks. The Aces were trying to clear up salary-cap room to sign two-time MVP Candace Parker, who agreed to a deal Jan. 28. 

            Hamby agreed to a two-year contract extension with Las Vegas in June. After she was traded, she posted on Instagram: “Being traded is a part of the business. Being lied to, bullied, manipulated, and discriminated against is not.”

            Hamby, who is pregnant with her second child, stuck by her words in her introductory news conference with the Sparks.

            Aces President Nikki Fargas responded to Hamby's comments Tuesday during Parker's introductory news conference, but didn't use Hamby's name in saying that “our players and their families will always be in the forefront of who we are as a franchise.”

            “We are here to assemble the best team possible, and when putting together a team, there are times when trades will happen,” Fargas said. “But that’s for us to also remain competitive. The moves we’ve made, obviously, have given us the flexibility we needed to sign (those) players.” 

            Las Vegas guard Kelsey Plum, who was elected to serve as first vice president of the WNBPA's executive committee in December, was asked about the allegations levied by Hamby.

            “It’s tough. ... I wear a lot of different hats. I’m best friends with Dearica. I am vice president of the players’ association, and I’m a very proud member of the Las Vegas Aces,” Plum said on a Zoom call from USA Basketball training camp in Minneapolis. “Because the investigation is going on, I can’t comment at this time. But in the meantime, I know that I can continue to support my friend and continue to be a proud member of the Aces, and continue to do my job as a VP.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804540,"Earthquake takeaways: Hope fading in frigid Turkey, Syria","GAZIANTEP, Turkey (AP) — The search for survivors of the earthquake that toppled thousands of buildings in Turkey and Syria reached a critical stretch on Wednesday, with rescue teams from two dozen countries helping locals sift through the rubble and experts warning that the realistic window to find any in the frigid temperatures was quickly closing.

            The death toll from the magnitude 7.8 quake that struck Monday neared 12,000, making it the deadliest since a magnitude 9.0 quake off the coast of Japan in March 2011 triggered a tsunami, killing nearly 20,000. Nearly all of Turkey is very seismically active so the country is no stranger to devastating earthquakes — a 7.4 magnitude temblor that struck near Istanbul in 1999 killed an estimated 18,000 people.

            With the damage from Monday's quake so extensive and spread so widely, experts said the window for survival was quickly closing, though people can survive for up to a week or more, depending on the circumstances.











            The extent of the devastation was breathtaking, with rows of apartment blocks reduced to twisted metal, rubble and dust in many communities. Rescuers formed human chains as they tried to dig through collapsed buildings, urging quiet every so often in the hopes of hearing stifled pleas for help.

            GLIMPSES OF HOPE

            The overwhelming sadness has given way to moments of muted joy. In the town of Jinderis in northwestern Syria, where 12 years of conflict has complicated rescue efforts, residents digging through a collapsed building Monday afternoon discovered a crying infant whose mother appears to have given birth to her while buried in the rubble. The girl's mother, father and four siblings didn't survive. Rescuers pulled another little girl from the wreckage of a collapsed building in the same town that evening.

            Former Chelsea and Newcastle forward Christian Atsu was rescued from the ruins of a collapsed building in the southern Turkey city of Antakya, where his current team, Hatayspor, is based, the Ghana Football Association tweeted Tuesday.

            In the southern Turkey city of Kahramanmaras, Mufit Hisir told The Associated Press that rescuers pulled his mother and brother alive from the rubble after digging for hours.

            MOUNTING FRUSTRATION

            Many whose homes were damaged or destroyed expressed frustration at the Turkish government response, having to sleep in cars, shelters or outside in subfreezing temperatures.

            “We don’t have a tent, we don’t have a heating stove, we don’t have anything. Our children are in bad shape. We are all getting wet under the rain and our kids are out in the cold,” Aysan Kurt, 27, told the AP. “We did not die from hunger or the earthquake, but we will die freezing from the cold. It shouldn’t be this way. No one is sending help.”

            Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan visited the especially hard-hit Hatay province, where more than 3,300 people died and entire neighborhoods were destroyed. Residents there have accused the government of being slow to send help.

            Erdogan, who faces a tough battle for reelection in May, acknowledged “shortcomings” in the response but said the weather had been a factor. The earthquake destroyed the runway in Hatay’s airport, further disrupting the response.

            He also hit back at critics, saying ”dishonorable people” were spreading “lies and slander” about the government’s response.

            Turkish authorities said they were targeting disinformation, and an internet monitoring group said access to Twitter was restricted despite it being used by survivors to alert rescuers.

            OFFERS OF AID

            Crews from at least 24 countries, including those at odds over the war in Ukraine, are taking part in the rescue operation.

            Among the countries helping is Turkey's neighbor and historic rival Greece, which is sending Turkey a team of 21 rescuers, two rescue dogs and a special rescue vehicle, together with a structural engineer, five doctors and seismic planning experts in a military transport plane.

            And aid groups including the International Committee of the Red Cross are sending assistance, including medical equipment, food, blankets, mattresses and other essential items.GAZIANTEP, Turkey (AP) — The search for survivors of the earthquake that toppled thousands of buildings in Turkey and Syria reached a critical stretch on Wednesday, with rescue teams from two dozen countries helping locals sift through the rubble and experts warning that the realistic window to find any in the frigid temperatures was quickly closing.The death toll from the magnitude 7.8 quake that struck Monday neared 12,000, making it the deadliest since a magnitude 9.0 quake off the coast of Japan in March 2011 triggered a tsunami, killing nearly 20,000.

Rescuers pulled another little girl from the wreckage of a collapsed building in the same town that evening.Former Chelsea and Newcastle forward Christian Atsu was rescued from the ruins of a collapsed building in the southern Turkey city of Antakya, where his current team, Hatayspor, is based, the Ghana Football Association tweeted Tuesday.In the southern Turkey city of Kahramanmaras, Mufit Hisir told The Associated Press that rescuers pulled his mother and brother alive from the rubble after digging for hours.MOUNTING FRUSTRATIONMany whose homes were damaged or destroyed expressed frustration at the Turkish government response, having to sleep in cars, shelters or outside in subfreezing temperatures.“We don’t have a tent, we don’t have a heating stove, we don’t have anything. Our children are in bad shape. We are all getting wet under the rain and our kids are out in the cold,” Aysan Kurt, 27, told the AP. “We did not die from hunger or the earthquake, but we will die freezing from the cold. It shouldn’t be this way. No one is sending help.”Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan visited the especially hard-hit Hatay province, where more than 3,300 people died and entire neighborhoods were destroyed. Residents there have accused the government of being slow to send help.Erdogan, who faces a tough battle for reelection in May, acknowledged “shortcomings” in the response but said the weather had been a factor. The earthquake destroyed the runway in Hatay’s airport, further disrupting the response.He also hit back at critics, saying ”dishonorable people” were spreading “lies and slander” about the government’s response.Turkish authorities said they were targeting disinformation, and an internet monitoring group said access to Twitter was restricted despite it being used by survivors to alert rescuers.OFFERS OF AIDCrews from at least 24 countries, including those at odds over the war in Ukraine, are taking part in the rescue operation.Among the countries helping is Turkey's neighbor and historic rival Greece, which is sending Turkey a team of 21 rescuers, two rescue dogs and a special rescue vehicle, together with a structural engineer, five doctors and seismic planning experts in a military transport plane.And aid groups including the International Committee of the Red Cross are sending assistance, including medical equipment, food, blankets, mattresses and other essential items.",2023/2/9,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804542,Chiefs' Mahomes says ankle will be ready for Super Bowl,"SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) — Patrick Mahomes says he's “definitely in a better spot” when it comes to his ailing right ankle than he was for the AFC championship game, and the All-Pro quarterback doesn't expect to be limited by it when he leads the Kansas City Chiefs against the Philadelphia Eagles in the Super Bowl.

            Mahomes said before Wednesday's practice at Arizona State's facility that he continues to get treatment on the ankle, which he hurt in the divisional round against Jacksonville, and that it will probably continue up until Sunday's kickoff.

            “You won't know exactly how it is until you get to game day,” he said. “I mean, I definitely move around better than I was moving last week or two weeks ago. So it's just trying to continue to get the treatment and the rehab and get it as close to 100% and then rely on some adrenaline to let me do a little bit extra when I'm on the field.”











            Mahomes hurt the ankle when a Jaguars pass rusher landed on it late in the first quarter. X-rays taken during the game came back negative, and he returned in the second half to lead Kansas City to the 27-20 victory.

            Mahomes spent the next week getting treatment on the ankle, and he credited trainers Rick Burkholder and Julie Frymyer with getting him in shape to play for the AFC title. And while he was clearly hobbled by the high ankle sprain, and several times limped away from hits, Mahomes was available against Cincinnati when the Chiefs needed him at the end.

            It was Mahomes who sprinted on his sore ankle in the closing seconds, then took a big late hit along the sideline, getting Kansas City within range of Harrison Butker's 45-yard field goal that punched its ticket back to the Super Bowl.

            “He's been doing really well with his ankle,” Chiefs coach Andy Reid said Wednesday. “We had a fast practice a couple days ago and he moved well. He can really do just about everything — at least everything in the game plan we asked him to do.”

            Still, concern about Mahomes' ankle persists. When Missouri Chief Justice Paul Wilson delivered his annual State of the Judiciary speech Wednesday to the Missouri Legislature, he added a twist to the typical closing line. 

            “May God bless each of you, may God continue to bless the great state of Missouri and, of course, may God bless Patrick Mahomes’ right ankle,” Wilson said to resounding applause from state lawmakers. 

            Back in Arizona, the Chiefs had everyone available as they ramped up with a more intense practice Wednesday.

            That included JuJu Smith-Schuster, who missed practice last week with swelling in his knee, and fellow wide receiver Kadarius Toney, who likewise skipped all the workouts in Kansas City with a sprained ankle. It also included cornerback L'Jarius Sneed, who cleared the concussion protocol this week and returned to practice.

            All three of those players, along with linebacker Willie Gay Jr., were hurt in the AFC championship game. Gay came away with a relatively minor shoulder injury and practiced last week along with this week.

            The Chiefs also are keeping a close eye on running back Clyde Edwards-Helaire, who was activated off injured reserve when wide receiver Mecole Hardman went on IR with a pelvis injury this week. The 2020 first-round pick has been out since November with a high ankle sprain, but there's a chance Edwards-Helaire could be active for the Super Bowl.

            If active, he would give the Chiefs a change-of-pace back behind Isiah Pacheco and Jerick McKinnon.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804544,New Year's Eve machete attack suspect pleads not guilty,"NEW YORK (AP) — A Maine man charged with attacking police officers with a machete near New York's Times Square on New Year's Eve pleaded not guilty Wednesday to attempted murder and assault charges in a new state indictment.

            Authorities have said Trevor Thomas Bickford of Wells, Maine, began studying radical Islamic ideology last summer. They say the 19-year-old decided in November to wage jihad against U.S. officials and officials of other governments he thought to be anti-Muslim.

            Bickford entered the plea to the 18-count indictment during an appearance in state court in Manhattan. His lawyer, Rosemary Vassallo, would only confirm the plea and declined further comment in an email to The Associated Press.











            Bickford is also facing federal terrorism charges.

            Three officers were injured in the attack at the edge of the high-security zone where throngs of revelers had gathered, about two hours before the new year began. Prosecutors say Bickford shouted “Allahu akbar” — the Arabic phrase for God is great — before striking the officers in the head with the machete and trying to grab an officer's gun. One officer suffered a fractured skull. 

            Bickford was shot in the shoulder by police and taken to a hospital. He's now detained without bail.

            Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg announced the state indictment earlier Wednesday. The charges include six counts of attempted murder and 10 assault charges.

            “Trevor Bickford allegedly carried out planned attacks on three members of the NYPD in Times Square on New Year’s Eve as they did their duty to protect our city,” Bragg said in a statement. “The charges contained in the indictment demonstrate just how seriously we are treating this incident.”

            The Legal Aid Society, a public defender organization representing Bickford, has urged the public “to refrain from drawing hasty conclusions and to respect the privacy of our client’s family.”NEW YORK (AP) — A Maine man charged with attacking police officers with a machete near New York's Times Square on New Year's Eve pleaded not guilty Wednesday to attempted murder and assault charges in a new state indictment.Authorities have said Trevor Thomas Bickford of Wells, Maine, began studying radical Islamic ideology last summer.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804545,"Ishbia takes over Suns, works to improve team culture","PHOENIX (AP) — Justin Ishbia came home from college one day to find his younger brother Mat shooting hoops over an 8-foot obstacle as he practiced for his upcoming high school basketball season.

            The older brother asked why the 5-foot-10 Mat was doing that — after all, no one in high school was 8 feet tall.

            “I'm going to be in the NBA one day,” Mat responded.











            Turns out that was true. It just took a couple billion bucks to make it happen.

            Mat Ishbia was introduced Wednesday as the new majority owner of the Phoenix Suns and WNBA’s Phoenix Mercury, after the NBA’s board of governors on Monday night approved his plan to purchase the controlling stake of those franchises from the embattled Robert Sarver.

            The crowd for Ishbia's high-energy speech included several former Suns players — particularly from the glory days in the 1990s — including Kevin Johnson, Tom Chambers and Dan Majerle. Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego was also in attendance.

            “Basketball is my life — a huge part of my life — always has been,"" Ishbia said. “So when I realized I wasn't good enough to be in the NBA, how can I one day maybe own a team? 

            ""I didn't know how realistic that was, but when you set big goals, you start walking toward them.”

            The 43-year-old Ishbia's first order of business is cleaning up an organization that was rocked after the NBA suspended Sarver in September for one year, plus fined him $10 million, after an investigation found he had engaged in what the league called “workplace misconduct and organizational deficiencies.”

            The punishment came nearly a year after the NBA asked a law firm to investigate allegations that Sarver had a history of racist, misogynistic and hostile incidents over his nearly two-decade tenure overseeing the franchise.

            Shortly afterward, Sarver announced he would be looking to sell the Suns and the Mercury. He bought the Suns in 2004 for $401 million, which at the time was an NBA record.

            Ishbia agreed on Dec. 20 to the deal, one that put the total value of the Suns and Mercury at $4 billion. 

            “I want to think big,” Ishbia said. “I want to think how to make this one of the elite franchises in the NBA and the WNBA. I want everyone to look at the Mercury and the Suns as the best. What does that mean? Best in class for fan experience, community engagement, culture and winning. How do we make it the best?”

            No other sale in NBA history has been completed with a $4 billion valuation of the franchise involved. Joe Tsai bought the Brooklyn Nets and Barclays Center for $3.3 billion in 2019, and Tilman Fertitta purchased the Houston Rockets for $2.2 billion in 2017.

            Now that it appears the franchise's ownership issues are settled, the Suns have a lot of momentum. 

            They've got a good young nucleus of Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, Mikal Bridges and Cam Johnson that made the NBA Finals less than two years ago before losing to the Milwaukee Bucks in six games. They've also got the reigning NBA Coach of the Year in Monty Williams and sold out 54 straight home dates at the recently renovated Footprint Center.

            Ishbia also takes over as the NBA trade deadline approaches later this week.

            Sarver's tenure as owner of the NBA’s Suns and WNBA’s Mercury officially ended Tuesday, when Ishbia — the chairman, president and chief executive of United Wholesale Mortgage, plus a walk-on member of Michigan State’s NCAA championship team in 2000 — took over. He will be governor, while his brother, Justin, will be alternate governor.

            Justin Ishbia will be the team’s second-largest shareholder, behind his brother. They acquired more than 50% of the franchise, which includes all of what was Sarver’s stake as well as some holdings of minority partners.

            Mat Ishbia also dealt with his first minor basketball ownership crisis on Wednesday. There was a report on Tuesday night linking Ishbia to his friend and former NBA star Isiah Thomas, who lost a sexual harrassment lawsuit when he was employed by the New York Knicks.

            Ishbia said he had no current plans to hire anyone — including Thomas — but didn't rule anything out in the future.

            “I’m going to spend a lot of time listening and learning, then make the adjustments to make this not only one of the best organizations in the NBA but also one of the best places to work,” Mat Ishbia told The Associated Press on Tuesday.

            Forbes recently listed Mat Ishbia's net worth as just over $5 billion. Ishbia’s company went public in January 2021 and is a rival to Quicken Loans — the company that has Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert as its founder and chairman.

            AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsPHOENIX (AP) — Justin Ishbia came home from college one day to find his younger brother Mat shooting hoops over an 8-foot obstacle as he practiced for his upcoming high school basketball season.The older brother asked why the 5-foot-10 Mat was doing that — after all, no one in high school was 8 feet tall.“I'm going to be in the NBA one day,” Mat responded.Turns out that was true. It just took a couple billion bucks to make it happen.Mat Ishbia was introduced Wednesday as the new majority owner of the Phoenix Suns and WNBA’s Phoenix Mercury, after the NBA’s board of governors on Monday night approved his plan to purchase the controlling stake of those franchises from the embattled Robert Sarver.The crowd for Ishbia's high-energy speech included several former Suns players — particularly from the glory days in the 1990s — including Kevin Johnson, Tom Chambers and Dan Majerle. Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego was also in attendance.“Basketball is my life — a huge part of my life — always has been,"" Ishbia said. “So when I realized I wasn't good enough to be in the NBA, how can I one day maybe own a team?""I didn't know how realistic that was, but when you set big goals, you start walking toward them.”The 43-year-old Ishbia's first order of business is cleaning up an organization that was rocked after the NBA suspended Sarver in September for one year, plus fined him $10 million, after an investigation found he had engaged in what the league called “workplace misconduct and organizational deficiencies.”The punishment came nearly a year after the NBA asked a law firm to investigate allegations that Sarver had a history of racist, misogynistic and hostile incidents over his nearly two-decade tenure overseeing the franchise.Shortly afterward, Sarver announced he would be looking to sell the Suns and the Mercury. He bought the Suns in 2004 for $401 million, which at the time was an NBA record.Ishbia agreed on Dec. 20 to the deal, one that put the total value of the Suns and Mercury at $4 billion.“I want to think big,” Ishbia said. “I want to think how to make this one of the elite franchises in the NBA and the WNBA. I want everyone to look at the Mercury and the Suns as the best. What does that mean? Best in class for fan experience, community engagement, culture and winning. How do we make it the best?”No other sale in NBA history has been completed with a $4 billion valuation of the franchise involved. Joe Tsai bought the Brooklyn Nets and Barclays Center for $3.3 billion in 2019, and Tilman Fertitta purchased the Houston Rockets for $2.2 billion in 2017.Now that it appears the franchise's ownership issues are settled, the Suns have a lot of momentum.They've got a good young nucleus of Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, Mikal Bridges and Cam Johnson that made the NBA Finals less than two years ago before losing to the Milwaukee Bucks in six games.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804546,Earthquake stuns Syria's Aleppo even after war's horrors,"BEIRUT (AP) — For years, the people of Aleppo bore the brunt of bombardment and fighting when their city, once Syria’s largest and most cosmopolitan, was among the civil war’s fiercest battle zones. Even that didn’t prepare them for the new devastation and terror wreaked by this week’s earthquake. 

            The natural disaster piled on many human-made ones, multiplying the suffering in Aleppo and Syria more broadly. 

            Fighting largely halted in Aleppo in 2016, but only a small number of the numerous damaged and destroyed buildings had been rebuilt. The population has also more recently struggled with Syria's economic downslide, which has sent food prices soaring and residents thrown into poverty. 











            The shock of the quake is all too much. 

            Hovig Shehrian said that during the worst of the war in Aleppo, in 2014, he and his parents fled their home in a front-line area because of the shelling and sniper fire. For years, they moved from neighborhood to neighborhood to avoid the fighting. 

            “It was part of our daily routine. Whenever we heard a sound, we left, we knew who to call and what to do,” the 24-year-old said. 

            “But … we didn’t know what to do with the earthquake. I was worried we were going to die.”

            Monday’s pre-dawn 7.8-magnitude quake, centered about 70 miles (112 kilometers) away in Turkey, jolted Aleppans awake and sent them fleeing into the street under a cold winter rain. Dozens of buildings across the city collapsed. More than 360 people were killed in the city and hundreds of others were injured. Workers were still digging three days later through the rubble, looking for the dead and the survivors. Across southern Turkey and northern Syria, more than 11,000 were killed. 

            Even those whose buildings still stood remain afraid to return. Many are sheltering in schools. A Maronite Christian monastery took in more than 800 people, particularly women, children and the elderly, crammed into every room.

            “Until now we are not sleeping in our homes. Some people are sleeping in their cars,” said Imad al-Khal, the secretary-general of Christian denominations in Aleppo, who was helping organize shelters. 

            For many, the earthquake was a new sort of terror — a shock even after what they endured during the war. 

            For Aleppo, the war was a long and brutal siege. Rebels captured the eastern part of the city in 2012, soon after Syria’s civil war began. For the next years, Russian-backed government forces battled to uproot them. 

            Syrian and Russian airstrikes and shelling flattened entire blocks. Bodies were found in the river dividing the two parts of the city. On the government-held western side, residents faced regular mortar and rocket fire from opposition fighters.

            A final offensive led to months of urban fighting, finally ending in December 2016 with government victory. Opposition fighters and supporters were evacuated, and government control imposed over the entire city. Activist groups estimate some 31,000 people were killed in the four years of fighting, and almost the entire population of the eastern sector was displaced.

            Aleppo became a symbol of how President Bashar Assad succeeded in clawing back most opposition-held territory around Syria’s heartland with backing from Russia and Iran at the cost of horrific destruction. The opposition holds a last, small enclave in the northwest, centered on Idlib province and parts of Aleppo province, which was also devastated by Monday’s quake. 

            But Aleppo never recovered. Any reconstruction has been by individuals. The city’s current population remains well below its pre-2011 population of 4.5 million. Much of the eastern sector remains in ruins and empty. 

            Buildings damaged during the war or built shoddily during the fighting regularly collapse. One collapse, on Jan. 22, left 16 people dead. Another in September killed 11 people, including three children. 

            Aleppo was once the industrial powerhouse of Syria, said Armenak Tokmajyan, a non-resident fellow at Carnegie Middle East who is originally from the city. Now, he said, it’s economically marginalized, basic infrastructure in gas and electricity is lacking, and its population – which had hoped for improvements after fighting ended – only saw things get worse.

            They have also now experienced the physical — and psychological — blow of the earthquake, Tokmajyan said. “It left them wondering, do they really deserve this fate or not? I think the trauma is big and it will take some time until they swallow this really bitter pill after (more than) 10 years of war.” 

            Rodin Allouch, an Aleppo native, covered the war for a Syrian TV station.

            “I used to be on the front line, getting video shots, getting scoops. I was never scared. Rockets and shells were falling and everything, but my morale was high,” he recalled. 

            The earthquake was different. “I don’t know what the earthquake did to us exactly. We felt we were going to join God. It was the first time in my life I got scared.” 

            During the war, he had to leave his neighborhood in the eastern sector and rent an apartment on the western side. But the quake has displaced him yet again. As their building shook, he, his wife and four children fled to a nearby garden. Allouch said he won't return until the building is inspected and repaired. It still stands, but has many cracks. The family will instead stay in a ground-floor store front nearby that he rented. 

            “It is safer to be down (on ground floor) if there is an earthquake,” he said, but complained that there is no fuel for heating. “Life is so miserable.""

            Many others in Aleppo have been displaced more than once. 

            Farouk al-Abdullah fled his farm south of Aleppo city during the war. Since then, he has been living with his two wives, 11 children and 70-year-old mother in Jenderis, an opposition-held town in Aleppo province. 

            Their building there collapsed completely in the earthquake, though the entire family was able to escape.

            He said the earthquake, with its destruction everywhere and its aftermath — watching rescue crews pull bodies out of the rubble — “are much more horrible than during the war."" 

            And while war may be senseless, those in it often have a cause they are sacrificing for and wrest some meaning out of the death and destruction. 

            The war’s devastation in Aleppo at least “is somehow a proof that we weren’t defeated easily,” said Wissam Zarqa, an opposition supporter from the city who was there throughout the siege and now lives in the Turkish capital Ankara.

            “But the destruction of natural disasters is all pain and nothing else but pain.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804548,MS-13 gang members in Central America sanctioned by US,"The United States Treasury Department sanctioned two members of the powerful Mara Salvatrucha on Wednesday, part of ongoing efforts by the U.S. to crack down on the gang commonly known as MS-13. One of the men is still at large.

            The sanctions were imposed on men in Honduras and Nicaragua, each accused of “drug trafficking, violence, murder, extortion, and money laundering” in Central America and the U.S., treasury official Brian E. Nelson said in a statement.

            The measure freezes the men's property and blocks them from making any financial transactions in the U.S., Nelson said. 











            “MS-13 is a violent, destabilizing threat to the security of people in Central America,"" Nelson said. “Its criminal activities degrade economies in the region to such a degree that citizens are compelled to seek safety and better opportunities elsewhere.”

            One of the men charged, Yulan Adonay Archaga Carias, also known as “Alexander Mendoza” or “Porky,” is a powerful MS-13 leader based in Honduras who is accused of ordering the killings of rival gang members and trafficking cocaine to the U.S., Nelson said. He escaped from a Honduran prison in 2020.

            The administration of President Joe Biden announced a $5 million reward for information leading to Archaga Carias' capture. He remains one of the FBI's 10 most-wanted fugitives.

            The second man sanctioned by the Treasury, David Elias Campbell Licona, also known as “Jorge Eduardo Perez Paz,” is known as a gang associate in Nicaragua, and is currently imprisoned in the country, Nelson said. He’s accused of laundering drug money and working with Archaga Carias to plan violent attacks.

            MS-13 is a transnational gang that originated in Los Angeles, and has since gained a grip on much of Central America. The American government blames violence generated by the group as a driver of migration to the U.S.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804553,Tyre Nichols documents: Officer never explained stop to him,"MEMPHIS, Tennessee (AP) — The officer who pulled Tyre Nichols from his car before police fatally beat him never explained why he was being stopped, newly released documents show, and emerging reports from Memphis residents suggest that was common.

            The Memphis Police Department blasted Demetrius Haley and four other officers as “blatantly unprofessional” and asked that they be stripped of the ability to work as police for their role in the Jan. 7 beating, according to documents released Tuesday by the Tennessee Peace Officers Standards and Training Commission.

            They also include revelations that Haley took photographs of Nichols as he lay propped against a police car, then sent the photos to other officers and a female acquaintance. 











            Nichols died three days later — the latest police killing to prompt nationwide protests and an intense public conversation about how police treat Black residents.

            Yet what led to it all remains a mystery.

            The five officers — Haley, Desmond Mills Jr., Tadarrius Bean, Justin Smith and Emmitt Martin III — have been fired and charged with second-degree murder. The new documents offer the most detailed account to date of those officers’ actions. Their attorneys have not commented to The Associated Press about the documents.

            Another officer also has been fired and a seventh suspended of duty. Six others may be disciplined, officials disclosed, without providing any details. That would bring the total involved to 13.

            Erica Williams, a spokeswoman for the top prosecutor in Memphis, said more charges could still be filed.

            Meanwhile, other residents are coming forward about interactions with Memphis police. 

            A federal lawsuit filed Tuesday accuses the same officers now charged with murdering Nichols, 29, with also violating the rights of another man from the same neighborhood as Nichols during a similarly violent arrest three days before Nichols' arrest.

            According to the lawsuit, Monterrious Harris, 22, was visiting a cousin at an apartment on the evening of Jan. 4 when his car was “suddenly swarmed by a large group of assailants wearing black ski-masks, dressed in black clothing, brandishing guns, other weapons, hurling expletives and making threats to end his life if he did not exit his car.”

            Harris thought the men were trying to rob him, the lawsuit says, and he tried to back up his car before hitting something. He then reluctantly exited with his hands raised and was “grabbed, punched, kicked and assaulted” for up to two minutes, the complaint states. The beating stopped only after people came out of their apartments to see what was happening, the lawsuit alleges.

            Photos of Harris’ face taken after his release on bail about nine days later show thick scabs on his forehead and a healing black eye.

            The suit accuses officers of fabricating evidence to support charges against Harris, including being a convicted felon in possession of a handgun, criminal trespass and evading arrest.

            Also, a woman told WREG-TV that she tried to warn the Memphis Police Department about Haley after a Feb. 21, 2021, encounter. Kadejah Townes said she was returning a movie to a Redbox machine at a Walgreens when police responded to a false shooting call. Police initially told her she could leave, she said, but then officers stopped her when she put her car in reverse. Haley placed handcuffs on Townes so roughly that she feared her arm was dislocated, she said. 

            Her aunt recorded the encounter. Then police stopped her aunt and brother while they followed a squad car as it took Townes to a hospital. Townes said she was never charged with anything.

            Haley’s disciplinary file showed that after Townes filed a complaint, he was written up for failing to fill out proper paperwork — not for use of force.

            “I wasn’t surprised,” Townes told the TV station.

            Police Chief Cerelyn “CJ” Davis signed requests seeking to prohibit the five charged officers from working in law enforcement again. The Tennessee Peace Officers Standards and Training Commission will decide later whether to do that.

            Haley, who was driving an unmarked car and wearing a black hoodie, forced Nichols from his car using profanity, then sprayed him in the eyes with a chemical irritant, according to the documents released Tuesday.

            “You never told the driver the purpose of the vehicle stop or that he was under arrest,” the documents state.

            Haley did not have his body camera on when he stopped Nichols but was on a phone call with someone who overheard. 

            Nichols ran from officers but was caught again a few blocks away. At that point, Haley kicked him in the torso as three other officers were handcuffing him. Other officers kicked Nichols in the face, punched him or struck him with a baton. 

            Charges against the other officers include that they misled officials about what happened. 

            Martin, for instance, claimed Nichols tried to snatch the officer’s gun from his holster after Haley forced him out of the vehicle, with Martin helping by grabbing Nichols’ wrist. However, video doesn’t corroborate the gun-grab claim, the documents said.

            In a letter from Smith included in his file, he defended his conduct, stating that Nichols was “violent and would not comply.”

            Audio from a body camera did not capture Nichols using profanity or making violent threats — instead, he appeared calm and polite in his comments to the officers. 

            The documents also highlight the failure to provide aid afterward, with Bean’s indifference to Nichols’ distress reported by a civilian who recorded video that has not been released.

            All five also were faulted for violating rules on body cameras — either by not having them on the whole time or taking off their vests with cameras attached, the documents said.

The new documents offer the most detailed account to date of those officers’ actions. Their attorneys have not commented to The Associated Press about the documents.Another officer also has been fired and a seventh suspended of duty. Six others may be disciplined, officials disclosed, without providing any details. That would bring the total involved to 13.Erica Williams, a spokeswoman for the top prosecutor in Memphis, said more charges could still be filed.Meanwhile, other residents are coming forward about interactions with Memphis police.A federal lawsuit filed Tuesday accuses the same officers now charged with murdering Nichols, 29, with also violating the rights of another man from the same neighborhood as Nichols during a similarly violent arrest three days before Nichols' arrest.According to the lawsuit, Monterrious Harris, 22, was visiting a cousin at an apartment on the evening of Jan. 4 when his car was “suddenly swarmed by a large group of assailants wearing black ski-masks, dressed in black clothing, brandishing guns, other weapons, hurling expletives and making threats to end his life if he did not exit his car.”Harris thought the men were trying to rob him, the lawsuit says, and he tried to back up his car before hitting something. He then reluctantly exited with his hands raised and was “grabbed, punched, kicked and assaulted” for up to two minutes, the complaint states. The beating stopped only after people came out of their apartments to see what was happening, the lawsuit alleges.Photos of Harris’ face taken after his release on bail about nine days later show thick scabs on his forehead and a healing black eye.The suit accuses officers of fabricating evidence to support charges against Harris, including being a convicted felon in possession of a handgun, criminal trespass and evading arrest.Also, a woman told WREG-TV that she tried to warn the Memphis Police Department about Haley after a Feb. 21, 2021, encounter. Kadejah Townes said she was returning a movie to a Redbox machine at a Walgreens when police responded to a false shooting call. Police initially told her she could leave, she said, but then officers stopped her when she put her car in reverse. Haley placed handcuffs on Townes so roughly that she feared her arm was dislocated, she said.Her aunt recorded the encounter. Then police stopped her aunt and brother while they followed a squad car as it took Townes to a hospital. Townes said she was never charged with anything.Haley’s disciplinary file showed that after Townes filed a complaint, he was written up for failing to fill out proper paperwork — not for use of force.“I wasn’t surprised,” Townes told the TV station.Police Chief Cerelyn “CJ” Davis signed requests seeking to prohibit the five charged officers from working in law enforcement again. The Tennessee Peace Officers Standards and Training Commission will decide later whether to do that.Haley, who was driving an unmarked car and wearing a black hoodie, forced Nichols from his car using profanity, then sprayed him in the eyes with a chemical irritant, according to the documents released Tuesday.“You never told the driver the purpose of the vehicle stop or that he was under arrest,” the documents state.Haley did not have his body camera on when he stopped Nichols but was on a phone call with someone who overheard.Nichols ran from officers but was caught again a few blocks away. At that point, Haley kicked him in the torso as three other officers were handcuffing him. Other officers kicked Nichols in the face, punched him or struck him with a baton.Charges against the other officers include that they misled officials about what happened.Martin, for instance, claimed Nichols tried to snatch the officer’s gun from his holster after Haley forced him out of the vehicle, with Martin helping by grabbing Nichols’ wrist.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804554,Rare home win for Marseille against rival PSG in French Cup,"Marseille celebrated its first home win against Paris Saint-Germain in more than a decade to reach the quarterfinals of the French Cup, beating its bitter rival 2-1 on Wednesday. 

            Cheered on by buoyant fans at a packed Stade Velodrome, Marseille had rarely looked so dominant against PSG since the Paris club started its supremacy in France after Qatari investors took over.

            Marseille's previous win at the Velodrome against PSG in all competitions dated back to November 2011.











            Alexis Sanchez put the hosts in front in the fixture known as “Le Classique” of French soccer, and Ukraine attacking midfielder Ruslan Malinovskyi scored the winner after Sergio Ramos pulled one back.

            “We are delighted to progress to the next round, the French Cup is one of our goals,” Marseille captain Valentin Rongier said. “Our fans had been waiting for that win, we are so happy to share it with them.”

            It was PSG's third loss this season. It came ahead of a major test as Bayern Munich travels to the French capital for the first leg of their round-of-16 match in the Champions League on Feb. 14. 

            Igor Tudor’s players imposed an intense pressing from the start that destabilized PSG. Second-best in all sectors, the visitors were pegged in their own half and Marseille piled up chances in the first half.

            The hosts could have been awarded a penalty after Achraf Hakimi elbowed the ball in the area, but referee Francois Letexier ignored calls from Marseille players.

            Marseille came close with efforts from Sead Kolasinac and Cengiz Under before Sanchez dribbled past Sergio Ramos on the right side and cut back inside the box, with the Spain defender bringing him down.

            This time, Letexier pointed to the spot and Sanchez wrong-footed Gianluigi Donnarumma in the 31th minute for his 11th goal in a Marseille shirt.

            On the back foot, PSG had to rely on individual talent to respond. Neymar hit the post with a long-range shot.

            Marseille, however, continued its dominance and could have doubled its lead before halftime as Jonathan Clauss forced a good save from Donnarumma on the counter. 

            But it was PSG which pulled one back against the run of play just before the break when Ramos, left unmarked in the box, headed home a corner. 

            PSG, missing Kylian Mbappe through injury, played higher in the second half and the game was more balanced, progressing at a slower pace.

            Marseille again went ahead in the 57th when Malinovskyi, who joined the southern side on loan during the winter transfer window, fired a superb strike from outside the box past Donnarumma after defenders failed to clear the ball. PSG pressed hard in the closing stages but could not find an edge. 

            PSG and Marseille are first and second in the French league, respectively. They will meet again on Feb. 26 at the Velodrome in the league.

            Earlier, French Cup holder Nantes snatched a late equalizer against Angers before prevailing in a penalty shootout to advance to the quarterfinals.

            After conceding an early goal, Nantes struggled to find an edge until Florent Mollet beat goalkeeper Paul Bernardoni with a powerful half-volley with three minutes left.

            The match finished 1-1 and Nantes' players were flawless during the 4-2 shootout while Amine Salama and Faouzi Ghoulam missed for the hosts.

            Lyon wasted a two-goal lead but also advanced 4-2 on penalties against top-tier rival Lille after finishing 2-2. 

            Goals from Ryan Cherki and Alexandre Lacazette had given Lyon a 2-0 advantage after 21 minutes. Jonathan David pulled one back in the 29th before Edon Zhegrova leveled soon after the hour-mark. Lyon goalkeeper Anthony Lopes then denied Mohamed Bayo's effort during the shootout before Timothy Weah hit the crossbar.

            Second-division side Rodez beat Auxerre 3-2, with Grenoble and Annecy also advancing. Reims lost 3-1 at Toulouse.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804555,Mexican avocados shipped for Super Bowl named in complaint,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — One year after the Super Bowl season was marred by a ban on Mexican avocado shipments, another threat has emerged: An environmental complaint that avocado growers are destroying forests that provide critical habitat for monarch butterflies and other creatures.

            The complaint, filed with the trilateral Commission for Environmental Cooperation, part of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade accord, accuses the Mexican government of failing to enforce its own laws on deforestation, water conservation and land use. 

            Avocado orchards grow at about the same altitude and climate conditions as the pine and fir forests in Michoacan, where migrating butterflies gather each year. Growers often cut down virgin forest to plant avocados for U.S. consumers. The butterflies, because they winter at a higher altitude, are not directly threatened, but the forests around their mountaintop reserves are.











            Julio Santoyo is part of a group of environmentalists in the town of Villa Madero, Michoacan where activists have suffered for years from kidnappings and threats from illegal logging gangs that clear land for unauthorized avocado orchards. The orchards require much more water than the native pines.

            Santoyo said he doesn't know who filed the complaint, but he supports it.

            “The complaint helps make the problem more visible, and it may help create environmental regulation that is needed” in the avocado industry, Santoyo said. “The truth is that it is well-founded, and the points it raises are what we have been complaining about and which continue to occur.”

            Activists in Villa Madero say they regularly see swaths of forest cut down and irrigation ponds dug to water avocado saplings. At least two activists have been abducted, threatened and beaten when they complained about the deforestation. 

            Mexico has been the deadliest place in the world for environmental and land defense activists, according to a global survey by the nongovernmental group Global Witness, with 54 activists killed in 2021. 

            The avocado growers also face threats in Michoacan, where they are routinely subject to extortion by drug cartels.

            A commission statement said the person or group that filed complaint is not being released, presumably to protect them from reprisals. 

            The complaint “asserts that Mexico is failing to effectively enforce its environmental laws to protect forest ecosystems and water quality from the adverse environmental impacts of avocado production in Michoacán, Mexico,” according to the office.

            It “claims that Mexico is failing to uphold provisions of the Mexican Constitution and various federal laws focused on environmental impact assessment, forestry conservation, sustainable development, water quality, climate change and environmental protection.”

            The complaint claims that the number of orchards certified to export fruit quadrupled between 2010 and 2021 growing from 14,181 to 63,559. The document says there are as much as a half-million acres (280,000 hectares) of avocado orchards in the western state. 

            “This growth has come at the expense of the forests,” the complaint states.

            The association of Michoacan avocado packers and growers refused to comment on the complaint, but said it has supported reforestation efforts.

            Shipments of avocados intended for consumption during the Super Bowl have already been sent north, so the complaint won’t effect on this year’s supply. 

            Last year, the United States briefly stopped the inspections of Mexican avocados that are required to export the fruit. The inspections, done to ensure Mexican avocados don’t carry diseases or pests that would harm U.S. orchards, were halted after one of the U.S. inspectors was threatened for rejecting a shipment in Michoacan. 

            The inspections resumed after a few days, when both nations agreed to enact measures to ensure the inspectors' safety.MEXICO CITY (AP) — One year after the Super Bowl season was marred by a ban on Mexican avocado shipments, another threat has emerged: An environmental complaint that avocado growers are destroying forests that provide critical habitat for monarch butterflies and other creatures.The complaint, filed with the trilateral Commission for Environmental Cooperation, part of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade accord, accuses the Mexican government of failing to enforce its own laws on deforestation, water conservation and land use.Avocado orchards grow at about the same altitude and climate conditions as the pine and fir forests in Michoacan, where migrating butterflies gather each year.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804556,How long can people survive in the rubble of an earthquake?,"How long can trapped people survive in the rubble of an earthquake?

            Up to a week or more, experts say, but it depends on their injuries, how they are trapped and weather conditions. 

            Search teams from around the world have joined local emergency personnel in Turkey and Syria to look for victims from this week's devastating earthquake that has killed thousands. 











            Most rescues occur in the first 24 hours after a disaster. After that, survival chances drop as each day passes, experts say. Many victims are badly injured or buried by falling stones or other debris.

            Access to water and air to breathe are crucial factors, along with weather. Wintry conditions in Syria and Turkey have hampered rescue efforts and temperatures have dipped well below freezing.

            “Typically, it is rare to find survivors after the fifth to seventh days, and most search and rescue teams will consider stopping by then,'' said Dr. Jarone Lee, an emergency and disaster medicine expert at Massachusetts General Hospital. ”But, there are many stories of people surviving well past the seven-day mark. Unfortunately, these are usually rare and extraordinary cases.'' 

            People with traumatic injuries, including crush injuries and limb amputations, face the most critical survival window, said Dr. George Chiampas, an emergency medicine specialist at Northwestern University’s Feinberg medical school. 

            “If you don’t pull them out in one hour, in that golden hour, there’s really a very low chance of survival,’’ he said.

            Those with other illnesses, whose health depends on medications, also face grim chances, Chiampas said.

            Age, physical and mental condition are all critical.

            “You see a lot of different scenarios where we’ve had some some really miraculous saves and people have survived under horrible conditions.,"" said Dr. Christopher Colwell, an emergency medicine specialists at the University of California, San Francisco. ""They tend to be younger people and and have been fortunate enough to find either a pocket in the rubble or some way to access needed elements like air and water.'' 

            After the 2011 Japan earthquake and tsunami, a teenager and his 80-year-old grandmother were found alive after nine days trapped in their flattened home. The year before, a 16-year-old Haitian girl was rescued from earthquake rubble in Port-Au-Prince after 15 days.

            Mental state can also affect survival. People trapped next to bodies, who have no contact with other survivors or rescuers, may give up hope, Chiampas noted.

            “If you have someone who is alive, you’re leaning on each other to keep fighting,’’ he said.

            The second-year pro will still have competition along the way, but Rivera's declaration appears to take the organization out of the running for high-profile veterans such as Aaron Rodgers, Derek Carr or even Jimmy Garoppolo, who was an option last year before the trade for Carson Wentz.

            That went poorly, so Howell takes the lead in the aftermath of the failed Wentz experiment.











            “Sam Howell is going to start out as QB1,” Rivera said on the AP Pro Football Podcast. “The key to that, though, is he’s going to have to earn it to keep, that’s for darn sure.”

            
                Washington drafted Howell in the fifth round last year out of North Carolina. Before a rough final college season, he was projected to be a top-10 pick — if not first overall.

            
                Howell made his NFL debut in the regular-season finale after the Commanders were eliminated from playoff contention. He threw and ran for a touchdown in beating the playoff-bound Dallas Cowboys. 

            “That game to me really epitomized what we potentially can be as a football team and what we should be,” Rivera said after being the recipient of the USAA Salute to Service Award.

            Howell was the eighth quarterback to start a game in three seasons since Rivera took over in Washington with control over football operations. 

            If he earns the job to start the season, Howell would be the team's seventh different Week 1 starting QB in as many years, following Wentz (2022), Ryan Fitzpatrick (’21), Dwayne Haskins (’20), Case Keenum (’19), Alex Smith (’18) and Kirk Cousins (’17). Wentz, who threw three interceptions in the loss to Cleveland that contributed to the Commanders being eliminated, is expected to be released before the start of the new league year in March.

            Rivera and the Commanders are still looking for an offensive coordinator after firing Scott Turner, who has since joined the Las Vegas Raiders.

            
                They've so far interviewed six candidates: San Francisco 49ers assistant head coach/running backs coach Anthony Lynn, former Denver Broncos offensive coordinator Pat Shurmur, current Washington quarterbacks coach Ken Zampese, Atlanta Falcons QBs coach Charles London, Miami Dolphins associate head coach/RBs coach Eric Studesville and Los Angeles Rams assistant head coach/tight ends coach Thomas Brown. London has since been hired as the Tennessee Titans' QBs coach and pass game coordinator.

            Washington would need to wait until after the Super Bowl to speak with Kansas City Chiefs offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804559,Organs in exchange for freedom? Bill raises ethical concerns,"BOSTON (AP) — A proposal to let Massachusetts prisoners donate organs and bone marrow to shave time off their sentence is raising profound ethical and legal questions about putting undue pressure on inmates desperate for freedom. 

            The bill — which faces a steep climb in the Massachusetts Statehouse — may run afoul of federal law, which bars the sale of human organs or acquiring one for “valuable consideration."" 

            It also raises questions about whether and how prisons would be able to appropriately care for the health of inmates who go under the knife to give up organs. Critics are calling the idea coercive and dehumanizing even as one of the bill's sponsors is framing the measure as a response to the over-incarceration of Hispanic and Black people and the need for matching donors in those communities.











            “The bill reads like something from a dystopian novel,” said Kevin Ring, president of Families Against Mandatory Minimums, a Washington, D.C.-based criminal justice reform advocacy group. “Promoting organ donation is good. Reducing excessive prison terms is also good. Tying the two together is perverse.”

            The bill would create a Bone Marrow and Organ Donation Program within the state Department of Correction to allow incarcerated individuals to receive a reduction in their sentence of between 60 days and a year on the condition that they have donated bone marrow or organs.

            Democratic state Rep. Judith Garcia, one of the sponsors of the bill, said it was filed in response to what she called the health inequities stemming from “the vicious cycle of unjust incarceration and over-policing of Black and Brown communities.” 

            Black and Hispanic communities are at higher risk for health conditions that might require organ donation, and discriminatory incarceration rates eliminate many likely donor matches from the pool leading to longer waitlists for African Americans compared to white individuals, she added.

            To be sure, the need for live-saving organs is great: There are more than 4,600 individuals in Massachusetts — and nearly 106,000 people in the U.S. — awaiting an organ transplant. About 28% of those in Massachusetts identify as Black, Hispanic or Latino, according to data collected by the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network.

            But critics say the measure goes about it the wrong way. 

            Offering reduced sentences in exchange for organs is not only unethical, but also violates federal law, according to George Annas, director of the Center for Health Law, Ethics & Human Rights at the Boston University School of Public Health. Reducing a prison sentence is the equivalent of a payment, he said. 

            “You can’t buy an organ. That should end the discussion,” Annas said. ""It’s compensation for services. We don’t exploit prisoners enough?”

            Democratic state Rep. Carlos Gonzalez, another co-sponsor of the bill, defended the proposal, calling it a voluntary program. He also said he’s open to establishing a policy that would allow inmates to donate organs and bone marrow without the lure of a reduced sentence. There is currently no law against prisoner organ donation in Massachusetts, he said.

            “It’s not quid pro quo. We are open to setting policy without incentives,” Gonzalez said, adding that it is “crucial to respect prisoners’ human dignity and agency by respecting their choice to donate bone marrow or an organ.”

            Garcia and Gonzalez are both members of the Massachusetts Black & Latino Legislative Caucus. 

            In 2007, South Carolina also sought to offer prisoners a reduced sentence in exchange for donating an organ. After criticism of the proposal, the state instead created a voluntary tissue and organ donation program for prisoners without offering any reduced sentences in exchange. Federal prisoners are allowed to donate organs, but only when the recipient is a member of the inmate’s family.

            The Massachusetts bill would create a committee to decide the amount of bone marrow and organs that must be donated to earn a sentence reduction. The bill would set a maximum of “not more than 365 day reduction” in their sentence for any prisoner who participated in the program.

            The Department of Correction would be barred from receiving any payments for bone marrow donations.

            The bill appears to face unlikely odds in the Statehouse. It has only a handful of legislative supporters and Democratic House Speaker Ronald Mariano sounded a skeptical note this week.

            “It’s kind of an extreme way to get your sentence reduced,"" he said. ""I don’t know if it makes much sense.”BOSTON (AP) — A proposal to let Massachusetts prisoners donate organs and bone marrow to shave time off their sentence is raising profound ethical and legal questions about putting undue pressure on inmates desperate for freedom.The bill — which faces a steep climb in the Massachusetts Statehouse — may run afoul of federal law, which bars the sale of human organs or acquiring one for “valuable consideration.""It also raises questions about whether and how prisons would be able to appropriately care for the health of inmates who go under the knife to give up organs.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804561,2 Indiana men could face life in prison in teen's 1975 death,"ALBION, Ind. (AP) — A judge told two Indiana men Wednesday that they could face life in prison if they're convicted in the slaying of a 17-year-old girl who was found dead in a river nearly a half-century ago.

            Fred Bandy Jr., 67, of Goshen and John Wayne Lehman, 67, of Auburn were arrested Monday on one count each of murder in Laurel Jean Mitchell's August 1975 death, Indiana State Police said Tuesday.

            Noble County Circuit Court Judge Michael Kramer told Bandy and Lehman during their separate initial hearings Wednesday that they face a charge of murder in the first degree, which was how murder was defined in Indiana at the time of Mitchell’s killing, The (Kendallville) News Sun reported.











            Under current Indiana law, a murder conviction carries a sentencing range of 45 to 65 years in prison, with the advisory sentence being 55 years. But because Mitchell's death occurred in 1975, Kramer said that if they're convicted of first-degree murder both men could be sentenced to life in prison, which was the maximum potential prison sentence in 1975.

            The judge also told Bandy and Lehman, who remain jailed without bond, that public defenders would be appointed to represent them.

            Mitchell was found drowned in the Elkhart River on Aug. 7, 1975, the morning after she failed to return home from her job at a church camp in her hometown of North Webster, about 140 miles (225 kilometers) northeast of Indianapolis.

            A probable cause affidavit filed Tuesday states that witnesses tied the men to Mitchell’s killing and DNA evidence linked Bandy to the crime.ALBION, Ind.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804562,Pentagon: China's conducted spy balloon program for years,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Chinese balloon shot down off the South Carolina coast was part of a large surveillance program that China has been conducting for “several years,” the Pentagon said Wednesday. 

            When similar balloons passed over U.S. territory on four occasions during the Trump and Biden administrations, the U.S. did not immediately identify them as Chinese surveillance balloons, said Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary. But he said “subsequent intelligence analysis” allowed the U.S. to confirm they were part of a Chinese spying effort and learn “a lot more” about the program.

            He refused to provide any new details about those previous balloons. When pressed, Ryder would only say that the balloons flew over “sites that would be of interest to the Chinese.”











            One of the possible incidents was last February.

            Maj. Gen. Kenneth Hara, the adjutant general in Hawaii, tweeted about a balloon over Kauai a year ago. He said U.S. Indo-Pacific Command “detected a high-altitude object floating in air in the vicinity of the Hawaiian Islands” and sent up aircraft to intercept it. He said they visually confirmed it was an unmanned balloon with no identification markings.

            Ryder declined to say whether this was one of the four previous incidents that the U.S. had discussed. Pacific Air Forces, the Air Force command in the Indo-Pacific, said that balloon was not shot down.

            The recent balloon was shot down by a U.S. military fighter jet on Saturday. The Navy and Coast Guard are still working to recover pieces of the downed balloon so they can be analyzed. 

            China claims it was a civilian balloon used for meteorological research and sharply criticized the U.S. for shooting it down. 

            In response to questions about China's explanation, Ryder said Wednesday that, “I can assure you this was not for civilian purposes ... we are 100% clear about that.”

            Ryder said North American Aerospace Defense Command began tracking the balloon as it approached U.S. airspace. It passed north of the Aleutian Islands on Jan. 28 and moved largely over land across Alaska and then into Canadian airspace before crossing back into the U.S. over northern Idaho on Jan. 31, U.S. officials have said. 

            Top administration officials were briefing members of Congress on the Chinese balloon surveillance program in classified sessions on Wednesday and Thursday. Avril Haines, director of national intelligence; Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman; Gen. Glen VanHerck, head of U.S. Northern Command; and Colin Kahl, the under secretary of defense for policy, were among those expected to brief lawmakers.

            Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the U.S. has briefed dozens of countries on the program, which officials said has been active over five continents.

            “The United States was not the only target,” he said at a news conference with visiting NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg. Blinken said he and Stoltenberg had spoken about the “systemic and tactical challenges” that China poses to the alliance and the importance of combatting them.

            The foreign countries would include nations the U.S. believes have been surveilled in the past as well as NATO allies. 

            Stoltenberg agreed on the nature of the Chinese threat, saying the balloon incident “confirms a pattern of Chinese behavior"" and noting that Beijing had “invested heavily in new military capabilities, including different types of surveillance and intelligence platforms.”

            “We have also seen increased Chinese intelligence activities in Europe,” he said. “We just have to be vigilant. We need to be aware of the constant risk of Chinese intelligence and step up what we do to protect ourselves.”

            Those briefings were continuing Wednesday, and the State Department has sent a cable to all U.S. embassies and consulates outlining the administration’s case against China and instructing American diplomats to discuss these points with their host governments. However, the cable is less specific than what has been briefed to allies and partners.

            Off the South Carolina coast, meanwhile, Navy divers began pulling pieces of the downed Chinese spy balloon from the depths of the ocean floor on Tuesday, using sophisticated reconnaissance drones dubbed the Kingfish and the Swordfish to locate the debris.

            Ryder said agents from the FBI and the Naval Criminal Investigative Service are cataloguing the debris and transporting it for further processing.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804563,Hamlin appears during Super Bowl event to receive award,"PHOENIX (AP) — Damar Hamlin made a brief appearance in Phoenix during Super Bowl week to receive the NFLPA's Alan Page Community Award. 

            The Buffalo Bills safety received the award at the Phoenix Convention Center on Wednesday, a little over a month after he went into cardiac arrest and needed to be resuscitated on the field in Cincinnati.

            “One of my favorite quotes: it’s a blessing to be a blessing,” Hamlin said, reading from a brief statement with his parents on stage with him. “With that being said, I plan to never take this position for granted and always have an urgent approach to making a difference in the community where I come from and also communities across the world.”











            Hamlin was one of five finalists for the Alan Page Award, which annually recognizes one player who goes above and beyond to perform community service in his team city and/or hometown. His foundation received $100,000 with the award.

            “He is not only an individual who has overcome a tremendous amount, he’s not only a person who reminds us just how dangerous this game is, but also the spirit, the love, the joy, the fraternity of people who play this game,” NFLPA executive director Demaurice Smith said.

            Hamlin's toy drive fundraiser received unexpected GoFundMe donations in the days and weeks after he collapsed. Chasing M’s has since raised more than $9 million. 

            “Giving back to my community has always been a part of who I am,” Hamlin said. “I’m thankful for my father, who’s right here behind me, growing up watching him doing community days in our community. I always was waiting on my time when it came.”

            Hamlin collapsed on the field after a collision with a Cincinnati Bengals player and had to be resuscitated before being taken away by ambulance. He spent nearly a week in a Cincinnati hospital before being flown to Buffalo, where he spent a couple of days in the hospital before being released on Jan. 11.

            Hamlin started visiting the Bills' facility shortly after that and attended Buffalo's divisional game against Cincinnati, receiving a rousing ovation when he was shown on the video board.

            He still faces a long recovery. Hamlin's marketing representative Jordon Rooney said on Jan. 20 that the 24-year-old was still requiring oxygen and regular heart monitoring to ensure there are no setbacks.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804564,"Coaching conundrum, player departures rock All Blacks","WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — The expected appointment of a new head coach and reports of a growing exodus of leading players have begun to shake the All Blacks’ preparation for this year’s Rugby World Cup in France.

            New Zealand Rugby has indicated it likely will announce a successor to Ian Foster before the tournament begins, a move some observers have described as destabilizing.

            The issue became more fraught this week when Crusaders head coach Scott Robertson, one of the leading candidates to take over from Foster, said the announcement of a new All Blacks coach is imminent.











            New Zealand Rugby has rushed to douse speculation it is about to announce an appointment.

            In a one-sentence statement, it said: “New Zealand Rugby is continuing to have internal discussions but an announcement about the All Blacks head coach or process is not imminent.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804565,Review: Con artists accumulate in the slinky 'Sharper',"Almost invariably, we root for the con artist. 

            Seldom does the ingenuity and cleverness of a good hustler, card sharp or con man not win us over. They are, of course, walking metaphors for the movies. Through finesse and daring, they pull the wool over our eyes while emptying our pockets. 

            They're also great roles for actors, our best liars, to showcase their powers of slight-of-hand seduction and subtle transformation. “Sharper,” a fitfully delicious pile of deceptions and double-crosses, is made with evident appreciation for the genre. It opens with a definition of its title — “one who lives by their wits” — and “Sharper,” too, skates by nimbly enough by coasting on its cast's smarts. 











            “Sharper,” which opens in theaters Friday and lands Feb. 17 on Apple TV+, is a slinky, slick caper that finds ways to distort expectations while unfolding a puzzle-box narrative. Before its lesser third act, “Sharper” — propelled especially by the performances of newcomer Briana Middleton and the more veteran Sebastian Stan — manages to juggle its plot twists with panache. 

            It opens with a seemingly sweet note of romance. Sandra (Middleton) breezes into a used bookshop on the Lower East Side to pick up a copy of Zora Neale Hurston's “Their Eyes Were Watching God.” She tells the guy behind the counter — Tom (Justice Smith) — that she's getting her PhD in Black feminist studies. The scene could be a meet cute for a bookish romcom. But given that opening title card, we're on guard for the scam. She's forgotten money — is that the play? A free book? They go on a date and later return to the store to hold in their hands a first edition of “Jane Eyre.” Maybe that's the goal? A fiendish scheme to swipe rare Charlotte Brontës? But as a character says later in “Sharper,” if you're going to steal, steal big.

            “Sharper,” structured as a series of vignettes each titled after a particular character, unspools as a series of ever-expanding cons. First, there is Sandra, in need of $350,000 to rescue her drug addict brother from his debtors. Once that plays out, the second chapter rewinds to Sandra's past, and her chance encounter with a skilled grifter, Max (Stan). He takes Sandra under his wing to school on the art of deception. His system starts, kind of wonderfully, with reading the newspaper: “So you can lie about anything.” And he's single-minded about the work.

            “I don't watch movies,” Max says. “They're a waste of time.”

            First off, ouch. But this is also an early hint, in Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka's layered screenplay, that the grifters of “Sharper” — unlike, say, Paul Newman of “The Sting” or Leonardo DiCaprio of “Catch Me if You Can” — are a more sober variety of fabulist, less a stand-in for the make-believe of movies than a concept to question and interrogate.

            As “Sharper,” smoothly helmed by British TV director Benjamin Caron, continues to widen, it brings in more characters and backstories, including a New York socialite (Julianne Moore, also a producer) who's dating a billionaire widower (John Lithgow). But the progression begins to work against the film. As 'Sharper"" turns increasingly melodramatic, we're well-conditioned by then to look for the con, and see it coming a long ways out. The streetwise characters — especially the appealingly rigorous Max, who seems like he walked in from a Paul Schrader film or a David Mamet noir — also wouldn't be so easily duped by the late plot maneuvers. After a promising start, “Sharper” grows duller.

            But there's plenty here to savor. Middleton, who had a small role in George Clooney's “The Tender Bar,” brings such a shape-shifting radiance to the film that when she's not present, the movie sags even as its star power increases. And Stan, an actor I've not previously had a strong sense of, has never been so arresting on screen. His cool nonchalance gives “Sharper” a bracing edge. The scenes that pair Middleton and Stan together are its most potent. Plus, who can resist a con that includes, to pose as a PhD student, cramming great quotes of literature? Oh, the riches that can be unlocked by “Call me Ishmael.” 

            “Sharper,"" an A24 release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America for language throughout and some sexual references. Running time: 116 minutes. Three stars out of four.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804568,Irvin pulled from NFL Network's Super Bowl coverage,"PHOENIX (AP) — Michael Irvin has been pulled from the remainder of NFL Network's Super Bowl week coverage after a complaint about Irvin's behavior in a hotel Sunday night.

            The Hall of Fame wide receiver went on a Dallas radio station Wednesday and said he was asked by network officials to move to another hotel on Monday after what he described as a brief encounter with a woman.

            “Michael Irvin will not be part of NFL Network’s Super Bowl LVII week coverage,” NFL Network spokesman Alex Riethmiller said 











            In interviews with Dallas' 105.3 The Fan and the Dallas Morning News, Irvin said the conversation with the woman lasted between 45 seconds and one minute. Irvin also said he initially didn't remember the meeting because ""I had a few drinks, to tell you the truth.”

            Irvin said he did not know the woman and that there was “no sexual wrongdoing.”

            “Sunday night … when I came into the hotel, they asked what I did and I said, ‘I just went straight to the room,’” Irvin said during the “Shan & RJ” show. “But I guess I had met somebody in the lobby. Talked to somebody in the lobby for about a minute, and then I went to my room. And then after I got up there, they said they had to move me in the hotel. 

            “I said: ‘I didn’t talk to anybody. I went straight to the room.’ And then they showed it on camera that I did talk to somebody. I talked to this girl for about a minute.

            Irvin has been with NFL Network since 2009. He did appear during the network’s coverage of Super Bowl opening night on Monday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804569,Polish lawmakers approve law meant to help unlock EU funds,"WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Poland's lower house of parliament on Wednesday gave final approval to a new law on judicial accountability that the government believes will meet European Union expectations and help unfreeze billions of euros in pandemic recovery funds.

            Brussels suspended the aid for Poland, saying the government’s policies of exerting control over the judiciary violate democratic principles. The EU has called for essential changes before Poland can be granted access to more than 35 billion euros ($37 billion) of EU grants and loans. Some previous changes proposed by Poland did not go far enough for the EU.

            Following months of negotiations, the government proposed more changes that removed the controversial powers of the Supreme Court, as one of the so-called ‘milestones"" that Poland has agreed to meet to receive the funds. 











            The proposal was criticized in Poland, including among judicial circles where some argued that it was inconsistent with the country’s legal system. But the right-wing wing ruling coalition insists it constitutes a compromise that should lead to the releasing of the funds, a process they say will take many months. 

            Lawmakers at the powerful lower house, or Sejm, voted Wednesday 233-207 for the new law with 12 abstentions, illustrating the deep divisions in a parliament narrowly controlled by the governing Law and Justice party and its junior partners.

            The changes still need approval from President Andrzej Duda who said he will closely study them for adherence to Poland's constitution. Appointing judges is among the president's powers.

            EU Commissioner for Justice, Didier Reynders, reacted on Twitter saying: “I take note of the adoption by the Sejm of the new law on the judiciary. We will now continue to follow the next steps in the legislative process. ”

            Government spokesman Piotr Mueller said earlier Wednesday that the new law was a “compromise” offered to Brussels that will “test the true intentions” of the bodies governing the 27-member bloc.

            Poland's government has been arguing that the EU was exceeding its powers in holding up the funds and trying to exert undue pressure.

            The new regulations move the divisive disciplinary and immunity procedures regarding judges from the Supreme Court to the main administrative court. They also broaden the possibility for the sides in a court trial of vetting judicial independence and authority. 

            It remained to be seen whether the EU would indeed find the new law satisfactory.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804570,"Democrats won Pennsylvania House, but bipartisan gap remains","HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Voters who kept three Pittsburgh-area state House seats in Democratic hands this week effectively also flipped control away from the Republican majority that has run the chamber for more than a decade, one of a handful of legislative bodies across the United States where partisan control shifted in recent months.

            In a chamber where majority control has been used to prevent many of their priorities from getting any serious consideration, Pennsylvania House Democrats are eager to take the reins.

            “It will mean common sense bills that have been held up in committee for a decade can finally be debated and voted on, and it will mean working with the new governor to deliver on an agenda that puts Pennsylvanians first,” said Democratic caucus spokesperson Nicole Reigelman.











            But with the Pennsylvania Senate firmly in Republican hands, the governorship retained by Democrats in November and a bare, one-seat state House margin, the recent elections can't be expected to make much change in Harrisburg's deep partisanship or its lengthy periods of inaction. 

            WHAT HAPPENED TUESDAY?

            The three special elections left House Democrats with 102 members and Republicans with 101; the GOP number will drop to 100 when a member departs soon after winning a special election for state Senate last week.

            The three new members will be seated once the results are fully tabulated and certified. Democrats are suddenly able to convert their agenda into actual legislation, but they are still going to need help from the Senate to send anything to the desk of Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro. 

            WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE SPEAKERSHIP?

            Despite their wins, Democrats were unable to elect their first choice as speaker, Rep. Joanna McClinton of Philadelphia, when the chamber met for the start of session on Jan. 3. Republicans, however, also failed to muster a majority for their preferred candidate, Rep. Carl Walker Metzgar of Somerset County.

            The result was a compromise choice, Reading area Rep. Mark Rozzi, a Democrat known mostly as a prime supporter of giving victims of childhood sexual abuse a two-year window during which they would be able to file otherwise outdated lawsuits. 

            Rozzi has said he wants to keep the job and has spent the past month working with a handpicked group of six lawmakers, three from each party, on what could be dramatic changes to how the House operates. 

            If they can develop rules that attract support across party lines, Rozzi might be able to prevent or at least forestall efforts to replace him with McClinton or some other candidate when the House returns to session Feb. 21.

            Rozzi told The Philadelphia Inquirer on Wednesday that he expects the child sexual abuse lawsuit legislation to be considered that week, after which he might “reassess” whether he wants to keep the speakership.

            MIGHT THERE BE MOVEMENT ON ISSUES?

            Two of the country's most hotly disputed political issues, changes to election procedures and access to abortion, have not seen movement in the past few years in Pennsylvania, largely because of its divided government. 

            Democrats pushing to give counties more advance time to process mail-in ballots have run into Republican hopes of reducing mail-in voting and making other changes. Shapiro has said he wants Election Day voter registration and automatic voter registration, policies legislative Republicans have largely ignored.

            Shapiro, like his predecessor, Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf, is a backer of abortion rights and, like Wolf, has said he will veto any restrictions. 

            With the House majority, however, Democrats have no reason to send any bill that limits access to abortion to Shapiro. The political fallout from last summer's U.S. Supreme Court ruling on abortion makes swing state Pennsylvania even more unlikely to be the site of abortion-related policy changes in the near future.

            “The most likely outcome for a lot of things is going to be nothing changes, right?” said Dan Mallinson, a public policy professor at Penn State-Harrisburg. “With abortion, you’re just not going to see the type of legislation that Republicans were talking about leading to the election.”

            HOW DOES THIS AFFECT THE NEW GOVERNOR?

            As a candidate and during his first month in office, Shapiro has conspicuously touted bipartisanship and pushed business-friendly policies. 

            But one of the first things the GOP-controlled Senate accomplished last month was to bundle together and pass the child sexual abuse lawsuit proposal along with expanded voter ID requirements and a measure to give lawmakers greater power to cancel a governor's regulations.

            By the time the next state budget is passed around the end of June, there should be clear evidence about whether Shapiro’s claim to have a “mandate” to bring people together and work with Republicans can translate into legislative wins.

            His press secretary, Manuel Bonder, said Shapiro sees room to work with both parties on education, public safety and economic issues. “Pennsylvanians have rejected extremism and elected leaders to work together and make progress on the issues that matter most — and that’s exactly what Gov. Shapiro will remain focused on doing every day,” Bonder said.

            ROLE OF HOUSE REPUBLICANS

            Republicans lost a net of 12 seats and the majority, but they have only one fewer vote than Democrats and could return to the majority if additional vacancies occur or they can persuade someone to switch parties. There are local races and judge elections that may well thin the Democrats' ranks later this year.

            The House Republican spokesperson, Jason Gottesman, said his members want to get the session underway.

            “Democrats, over the last three months, have argued in public and the courts that they have a majority,"" Gottesman said. “Hopefully, with last night's elections having come to a conclusion, Democrats can reverse their recent patterns and practices and stick to their word in joining with us to truly move Pennsylvania ahead for the people who live here.”HARRISBURG, Pa.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804571,AP source: 49ers QB Purdy to undergo surgery Feb. 22,"San Francisco 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy will undergo surgery on his injured elbow later this month and should be fully recovered by training camp.

            A person familiar with the decision said Purdy will undergo the surgery on Feb. 22 to repair the torn ligament in his right elbow. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the team didn't announce the decision. 

            NFL Network first reported the decision on surgery that will be performed by Dr. Keith Meister, the team physician for the Texas Rangers.











            Purdy tore the ulnar collateral ligament in his right elbow on the first drive of a 31-7 loss in the NFC title game to Philadelphia on Jan. 29.

            Purdy got several opinions from doctors on whether to avoid surgery and try to rehabilitate the elbow, have an “internal brace” procedure to repair the elbow or undergo reconstructive Tommy John surgery.

            He opted for the internal brace, which should allow him to begin a throwing program in three months and be fully cleared to practice sometime in August if everything goes as planned.

            Purdy went from the last pick of the draft to starter in the conference title game in an impressive rookie season for the 49ers. He won his first seven starts after stepping in for an injured Jimmy Garoppolo in Week 13 before the loss to Philadelphia in the conference title game. 

            Purdy threw for 1,374 yards with 13 touchdowns and only four interceptions in the regular season and his 108 passer rating in the regular season and playoffs was highest ever for a rookie with at least 200 passes.

            Purdy will miss the offseason program, giving 2021 first-round pick Trey Lance time to work with the first-team offense. Lance began this past season as the starter before breaking his ankle in Week 2. He is expected to be cleared to practice before the start of the offseason program.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804572,Investors' query: Can Google answer Microsoft's AI threat?,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Google, a company built on finding quick answers to people's questions, suddenly finds itself grappling for a response to a potential threat to its internet empire — a form of artificial intelligence that long-time rival Microsoft is now deploying to attack its dominant search engine.

            Microsoft's assault combined with concerns about Google's ability to ward it off hammered its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc., whose stock price plunged nearly 8% Wednesday in a selloff that wiped out about $100 billion in shareholder wealth. 

            It marked the steepest one-day decline since October when an Alphabet earnings report disclosed a slowdown in digital ad revenue that rattled investors. Those concerns have escalated since another report released last week revealed Google's ad sales during the holiday-season quarter fell from the same time in the previous year.











            Wednesday's downturn came after Google elaborated on its plans for a chatbot dubbed “Bard ” during an uninspiring presentation that included inaccurate information about space exploration. It contrasted with a much more polished and well-reviewed showcase of Microsoft's plans to incorporate an already popular chatbot, ChatGPT, into its Bing search engine — long a distant second to Google's de facto gateway to the internet.

            “It's not like this is the end of the world for Google and Microsoft is going to eat its lunch in search,"" said CFRA analyst Angelo Zino said. “But ChatGPT is showing there is possible threat and that is causing a lot of fear.”

            Google has been focusing on artificial intelligence for the past six years, but has been cautions about how it uses the technology in its search engine that holds a roughly 90% share of the internet market — in part because it's counted on as a go-to source for reliable information. 

            Although ChatGPT has attracted millions of users since its release late last year by OpenAI, it still makes glaring mistakes that would be mocked if they showed up in Google's search results. But Microsoft's Bing search engine has such a small sliver of the market that it can afford to experiment with what is still a largely untested technology.

            “Google has had to take a more measured approach, but Microsoft really has nothing to lose so why not use ChatGPT in search?"" said Edward Jones analyst David Heger.

            And Microsoft's increasingly reliance on ChatGPT — a technology that prompted the software maker to pour billions of dollars into OpenAI — may not be Google's only worry. Baidu, the leading search engine in China, is rolling out a chatbot called Ernie and, on Wednesday, veteran Google executive Clay Bavor announced he is leaving the company after 18 years working on a variety of major projects to launch an AI startup with former Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor.

            The AI challenges are confronting Google at a time it's also gearing up for an antitrust trial triggered by a U.S. Justice Department lawsuit aimed at its search engine. The trial, scheduled to begin in September, is considered to be the biggest antitrust case targeting a technology company since the department took aim at Microsoft's dominance in personal computer software more than 20 years ago. 

            While Microsoft became distracted battling antitrust regulators, Google seized on the opportunity to make huge inroads in search and become a tech powerhouse.SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Google, a company built on finding quick answers to people's questions, suddenly finds itself grappling for a response to a potential threat to its internet empire — a form of artificial intelligence that long-time rival Microsoft is now deploying to attack its dominant search engine.Microsoft's assault combined with concerns about Google's ability to ward it off hammered its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc., whose stock price plunged nearly 8% Wednesday in a selloff that wiped out about $100 billion in shareholder wealth.It marked the steepest one-day decline since October when an Alphabet earnings report disclosed a slowdown in digital ad revenue that rattled investors.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804573,"Virginia agency won't release 1,700 records on Ford talks","RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — Virginia's economic development agency says it has at least 1,700 emails and documents pertaining to talks about the possibility of a Ford Motor Co. battery plant landing at a Danville-area megasite. But it won't release any of them under the state's public records law. 

            The Associated Press sought the records in January after Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin disclosed that he intervened in an apparent effort by Virginia to land the project. Youngkin objected to the role of a Chinese company in the joint venture, which he has characterized as a “front” for the Chinese Communist Party that would raise national security concerns. 

            Lisa Wallmeyer, general counsel for the Virginia Economic Development Partnership, wrote in an email this week that about 1,700 emails and documents were found that matched AP's request but were being withheld for two reasons. 











            Wallmeyer said some records contain proprietary information voluntarily provided by a private business pursuant to a promise of confidentiality. Others are “memorandum and working papers developed by VEDP staff, the disclosure of which would adversely affect the financial interest of the public body,” she wrote. 

            The AP sought emails that included any discussion of the possible project in the possession of certain agency leaders and staff of the business investment division. 

            Separately, VEDP confirmed that no record exists of an incentive package offered by the state connection with the potential project. That's in line with a timeline provided by the governor, who has said the project never reached end-stage talks and that no incentive package was submitted.

            Reaction to the disclosure by Youngkin — who is widely seen as a possible 2024 presidential contender — has largely split along partisan lines.

            An internal investigation by the Oregon Liquor and Cannabis Commission, obtained by The Associated Press via a public records request Wednesday, concluded that Executive Director Steve Marks and five other agency officials had diverted sought-after bourbons, including Pappy Van Winkle’s 23-year-old whiskey, for their personal use. 

            The officials were paying for the whiskey, which can cost thousands of dollars a bottle, but they had used their knowledge and connections at the commission to obtain them, and consequently deprived members of the public of the spendy booze, the investigation said. And that violated Oregon statutes, including one that prohibits public officials from using confidential information for personal gain, the commission's investigation said.











            The Oregonian/OregonLive first reported the internal investigation.

            Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek on Wednesday asked the agency's board of commissioners to remove Marks and the other implicated officials, alleging they “abused their position for personal gain.”

            “This behavior is wholly unacceptable. I will not tolerate wrongful violations of our government ethics laws,” Kotek said in her letter to the board of commissioners.

            In his responses to questions from the investigator, Marks denied that he had violated Oregon ethics laws and state policy. However, he acknowledged that he had received preferential treatment “to some extent” in obtaining the whiskey as a commission employee. Marks and the other officials said they never resold the whiskeys they obtained. 

            “This incident underlines the importance of having public accountability,"" said agency spokesperson Mark Pettinger. ""The OLCC will need to work on rebuilding and restoring our public trust ... and adhere to Oregon’s ethics laws.”

            After taking office last month, Kotek, a Democrat who was a long-serving Oregon House speaker, asked for Marks' resignation, but no reason was announced. Kotek said she learned of this business about the bourbon afterward. 

            The board of commissioners is appointed by the governor and in turn selects the executive director, according to a commission spokesman. The commissioners' next regular meeting is next Wednesday. The agency is the state’s third-largest revenue generator.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804585,Greek F Giorgos Giakoumakis signs with Atlanta United,"ATLANTA (AP) — After cutting ties with Josef Martinez, Atlanta United bolstered its front line Wednesday with the signing of Greek forward Giorgos Giakoumakis.

            The 28-year-old Giakoumakis comes to Major League Soccer from Celtic FC, where he led the Scottish Premiership in goals and helped the team win both the league title and Scottish Cup.

            He has some big shoes to fill in Atlanta.











            Giakoumakis will take a designated player and international roster spot, essentially taking over for Martinez after the leading scorer in franchise history was let go by United and signed with Inter Miami.

            The signing ends a weeks-long pursuit of Giakoumakis that included reports of him heading to a Japanese team.

            In the end, Atlanta got a player it desperately needed to bolster a front line that lacked for offensive punch with the season opener just 2 1/2 weeks away.

            “Giorgos is a player who’s been on the club’s radar for a while and we’re excited to bring him to Atlanta,” technical director Carlos Bocanegra said in a statement. “He’s a powerful striker who loves to get in the box and score goals. He plays with a high intensity, works hard and is someone we think will help the team both in the attack and leading the line defensively.""

            Martinez was the face of the Atlanta franchise after United joined MLS as an expansion team in 2017.

            He set a league scoring record and earned MVP honors in his second year, leading United to the MLS Cup title. Martinez scored 111 goals in 158 appearances for Atlanta in all competitions.

            But the striker never regained his dynamic form after a severe knee injury in the 2020 opener knocked him out for the rest of the season. A falling-out with coach Gonzalo Pineda effectively ended his time in Atlanta, prompting the team to buy out his contract so he could sign with the Miami.

            Giakoumakis was the Scottish league's top goal scorer with 13 goals during the 2021-22 season, and he has tallied six goals in 19 appearances this season with Celtic again sitting atop the standings.

            Across all competitions, he scored 26 goals in 57 appearances for the Scottish powerhouse.

            After staring his career in his native country, Giakoumakis moved to VVV-Venlo in the Dutch Eredivisie in 2020. 

            He had a breakout year in the Dutch top flight with a league-leading 26 goals in 30 appearances, which led to him joining Celtic the following year.

            AP MLS: https://apnews.com/hub/major-league-soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsATLANTA (AP) — After cutting ties with Josef Martinez, Atlanta United bolstered its front line Wednesday with the signing of Greek forward Giorgos Giakoumakis.The 28-year-old Giakoumakis comes to Major League Soccer from Celtic FC, where he led the Scottish Premiership in goals and helped the team win both the league title and Scottish Cup.He has some big shoes to fill in Atlanta.Giakoumakis will take a designated player and international roster spot, essentially taking over for Martinez after the leading scorer in franchise history was let go by United and signed with Inter Miami.The signing ends a weeks-long pursuit of Giakoumakis that included reports of him heading to a Japanese team.In the end, Atlanta got a player it desperately needed to bolster a front line that lacked for offensive punch with the season opener just 2 1/2 weeks away.“Giorgos is a player who’s been on the club’s radar for a while and we’re excited to bring him to Atlanta,” technical director Carlos Bocanegra said in a statement. “He’s a powerful striker who loves to get in the box and score goals. He plays with a high intensity, works hard and is someone we think will help the team both in the attack and leading the line defensively.""Martinez was the face of the Atlanta franchise after United joined MLS as an expansion team in 2017.He set a league scoring record and earned MVP honors in his second year, leading United to the MLS Cup title. Martinez scored 111 goals in 158 appearances for Atlanta in all competitions.But the striker never regained his dynamic form after a severe knee injury in the 2020 opener knocked him out for the rest of the season.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804587,"Disney to cut 7,000 jobs in Iger's company 'transformation'","LOS ANGELES (AP) — The Walt Disney Co. will cut about 7,000 jobs as part of an ambitious companywide cost-savings plan and “strategic reorganization” announced Wednesday by CEO Bob Iger.

            The job cuts amount to about 3% of the entertainment giant's global workforce and were unveiled after Disney reported quarterly results that topped Wall Street’s forecasts. 

            Iger returned as CEO in November following a challenging two-year tenure by his handpicked successor, Bob Chapek. The company said the job reductions are part of a targeted $5.5 billion cost savings across the company. As of Oct. 1, Disney employed 220,000 people, of which about 166,000 worked in the U.S. and 54,000 internationally.











            In a statement, Iger said Disney is embarking on a “significant transformation” that management believes will lead to improved profitability at the company’s streaming business.

            The company, which owns Star Wars, Marvel and Pixar, will focus more on its core brands and franchises, Iger said.

            The executive also announced changes to how executives will operate Disney's various divisions. Specifically, creative executives will now be responsible for determining what movies, TV series or other content to produce, as well as the marketing and distribution. 

            “Our new structure is aimed at returning greater authority to our creative leaders and making them accountable for how their content performs financially,” Iger said during a call with Wall Street analysts.

            In its latest results, solid growth at Disney’s theme parks helped offset tepid performance in its video streaming and movie business. 

            Disney said Wednesday that it earned $1.28 billion, or 70 cents per share, in the three months through Dec. 31. That compares with net income of $1.1 billion, or 60 cents per share, a year earlier. 

            Excluding one-time items, Disney earned 99 cents per share. Analysts, on average, were expecting adjusted earnings of 78 cents per share, according to FactSet.

            Revenue grew 8% to $23.51 billion from $21.82 billion a year earlier. Analysts were expecting revenue of $23.44 billion.

            Disney said sales at its parks, experiences and products segment grew 21% to $8.74 billion, from $7.23 billion a year earlier. While revenue for the segment that includes Disney’s movie business edged up 1% to $14.78 billion from $14.59 billion a year earlier.

            The company's direct-to-consumer business, which includes its streaming services, posted a $1.1 billion operating loss amid higher programming and production costs at Disney+ and Hulu.

            Disney+ ended the quarter with 161.8 million subscribers, down 1% from since Oct. 1. Hulu and ESPN+ each posted a 2% increase in paid subscribers during the quarter. 

            The company rolled out new price tiers for its U.S. Disney+ service in December that raised the monthly price for ad-free viewing from $7.99 to $10.99 and created a new basic Disney+ service with ads that costs $7.99 a month.

            Management said Wednesday that Disney+ plus will achieve profitability by the end of its next fiscal year in September 2024.

            The latest results marked the first quarterly snapshot since Iger’s return as CEO.

            The move to revamp the company and slash costs comes as Disney is under pressure to turn its business around.

            Activist investor Nelson Peltz, CEO of Trian Fund Management, is vying for a seat on Disney's board of directors, arguing that the company’s recent operating performance has been disappointing and the result of self-inflected problems stemming from failed succession planning efforts, a flawed direct-to-consumer strategy and “over-the-top” compensation practices, among other concerns.

            Disney has urged shareholders to vote against Peltz and last month named board member Mark Parker as its chairman. Parker, who also serves as executive chairman at Nike Inc., has been tapped to head Disney’s newly created succession planning committee, which will advise the board on CEO succession planning.

            Iger also announced Wednesday that he intends to ask the board to approve the reinstatement of a “modest” dividend by the end of this year. The company suspended its dividend in the spring of 2020, in the early days of the pandemic. 

            Shares in Disney, which is based in Burbank, California, rose almost 6% in after-hours trading.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804588,South Carolina becomes only state with all-male high court,"COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — South Carolina on Wednesday became the nation's only state without a woman on its Supreme Court — a development that comes amid increasing Republican scrutiny of the court that narrowly struck down the conservative state's abortion ban last month.

            The Republican-led Legislature chose Judge Gary Hill to replace the high court's lone female justice, Kaye Hearn, who had reached the court’s retirement age and who wrote the leading opinion in the 3-2 ruling overturning the state's 2021 abortion ban.

            Hill was the only candidate for the position remaining after two female candidates, Judges Stephanie McDonald and Aphrodite Konduros, dropped out on Jan. 17, which was the day candidates could begin seeking legislators' support. Although nominees have previously left such races when they decided they lacked the votes, the departures have not often happened so swiftly.











            Hearn's departure and the abortion ruling have led to ardent discussions over gender diversity in the courts and the merits of South Carolina’s fairly unique judicial selection system. In most states, voters or the governor take the lead in choosing who sits on state courts. South Carolina and Virginia are the only two states where lawmakers exercise almost complete power over filling the bench.

            Under the current process, lawmakers consider a pool of up to three candidates for the high court who have been deemed qualified by a Judicial Merit Selection Commission comprised of four members of the public and six legislators. Candidates must then get a majority of the votes cast in a joint session of the General Assembly.

            Tensions reached a flashpoint during a Jan. 25 floor speech by state Sen. Sandy Senn. The Charleston Republican accused House Republicans of forcing the two women out after holding informal polls purportedly showing that neither would win. House Speaker Murrell Smith denied the allegations of premature pledging in a statement to the Post and Courier.

            “The smartest candidate, I believe, would’ve been the judge who left my partnership 12 years ago,"" Senn said in reference to McDonald, her former law firm colleague.

            “I fear that her loss is partly my fault because she got painted with a brush that I guess I set forth,"" added Senn, a vocal opponent of last year's efforts to further restrict abortion rights.

            Senn criticized the lack of gender diversity throughout the judiciary and called it “embarrassing” that the family court is the only place where women hold a majority of seats.

            Hill received support Wednesday from 140 of South Carolina’s 170 lawmakers. None of the five female state senators voted for him.

            Although many legislators agreed that gender should not be the sole factor, some women shared Senn's disappointment in the lack of female candidates. Others emphasized their focus on a nominee's background or philosophy.

            “I would just like to say on the behalf of the women here, that we believe in merit,"" Republican state Rep. April Cromer said Wednesday during a House Freedom Caucus news conference. ""To base it on anything other than what their qualifications are is discrimination.”

            The abortion decision continued to cast a shadow over the session. Hours before lawmakers convened to select Hill, the state Supreme Court denied state Attorney General Alan Wilson's petition for a rehearing.

            “As we've said previously, we respectfully disagree with the Court's decision,” Wilson said Wednesday in a statement. “The issue is now in the legislature's hands.”

            Republican leaders have quickly advanced differing abortion bans in both chambers this week.

            Meanwhile, various changes to judicial selection have been proposed this legislative session. In his State of the State speech, Republican Gov. Henry McMaster called for gubernatorial appointments “with the advice and consent of the state Senate” in a method that would resemble the federal government’s model.

            But leading lawmakers do not like the alternatives. They are unmoved by public elections that recently drew millions of advertising dollars in some places. Similarly unappealing to them are gubernatorial nominations like those in New York, where an intraparty fight broke out earlier this year after liberal legislators deemed Gov. Kathy Hochul’s nominee too conservative.

            Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey has endorsed “tweaks."" One bill would allow the Judicial Merit Commission to advance all qualified candidates, rather than just three potential nominees.

            Republican state Rep. Adam Morgan of the House Freedom Caucus reiterated his support Wednesday for a bill that would bar lawmakers' family members from election to judicial office while the legislator serves in the General Assembly.

            The concerns are not entirely new. A 1996 law banned lawmakers from seeking court positions until one year after either leaving office or failing to file for reelection. Every person who sat on the state Supreme Court in the 1990s had served in the Legislature at some point in their careers.

            No lawmakers expressed concerns over Hill's qualifications. The newest South Carolina Supreme Court justice assumed his position after a lengthy legal career. The 1989 University of South Carolina Law School graduate served as a circuit judge for 13 years before his most recent election to the state appeals court in 2017.

            “Admittedly, he is well-to-serve as a Supreme Court justice in this state,” Democratic Rep. Beth Bernstein said Tuesday at a committee hearing on a proposed abortion ban. “But by his election we will not have a female Supreme Court justice in this state — the only state in the nation.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804589,Former college student pleads guilty to deadly sword attack,"HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — A former University of Connecticut student pleaded guilty to murder and other charges Wednesday for killing a man and severely wounding another with a sword in 2020 — one of two deadly attacks that led to a six-day manhunt in several states that ended with his capture in Maryland.

            Peter Manfredonia, 26, from Newtown, Connecticut, agreed to a 55-year prison sentence during a hearing at Rockville Superior Court. Sentencing was set for April 20. He also is expected to plead guilty in connection with the second attack next week in state court in Milford, his lawyer said.

            Manfredonia answered questions from the judge about the plea agreement during the hearing, but did not say anything else. He pleaded guilty to murder, assault and home invasion.











            State's Attorney Matthew Gedansky said the victims and their families in both cases supported the plea bargain, which was the result of months of discussions.

            “It was a global resolution plea agreement between everybody — a lot of discussion between the two state’s attorneys, the families of the victims ... and the two judges,"" Gedansky said in a phone interview.

            Manfredonia's lawyer, Michael Dolan, called the plea agreement “a fair resolution” based on the evidence and seriousness of the charges. He said Manfredonia will plead guilty in the second case on Feb. 16 and receive another 55-year sentence, to run concurrently with the sentence in the other case.

            Police and prosecutors said Manfredonia killed Ted DeMers, 62, and seriously wounded an 80-year-old man who lost several fingers and part of his ear in a Samurai sword attack in Willington on May 22, 2020. 

            It's not clear why Manfredonia attacked the men. But an acquaintance of Manfredonia's lived near DeMers' home and told police she stopped seeing him recently.

            After the sword attack, police said Manfredonia broke into another man’s house in Willington and held him hostage for about 24 hours before taking off with his truck and firearms. The man later told police that Manfredonia told him “he just flipped.”

            Two days later, Manfredonia went to the Derby home of a high school friend, Nicholas Eisele, 23, and fatally shot him, authorities said. Manfredonia then forced Eisele's girlfriend into her car and fled the state, police said.

            After Manfredonia let the woman go near Columbia, New Jersey, investigators tracked him to Pennsylvania, where police said he took an Uber to a Walmart in East Stroudsburg. Authorities searched the area but didn’t find him. A man fitting his description was later spotted near Scranton, Pennsylvania, prompting another search there.

            Police believe Manfredonia stole a car and abandoned it in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, before taking another Uber to Hagerstown, Maryland, where he was captured without incident when police spotted him near a truck stop.

            Dolan, Manfredonia's lawyer, said Manfredonia was having mental health problems at the time and it was difficult for him to get help during the first months of the coronavirus pandemic.

            “His mental health issues weren’t being addressed and unfortunately he had a psychotic episode,” Dolan told The Associated Press Wednesday.HARTFORD, Conn.

He pleaded guilty to murder, assault and home invasion.State's Attorney Matthew Gedansky said the victims and their families in both cases supported the plea bargain, which was the result of months of discussions.“It was a global resolution plea agreement between everybody — a lot of discussion between the two state’s attorneys, the families of the victims ... and the two judges,"" Gedansky said in a phone interview.Manfredonia's lawyer, Michael Dolan, called the plea agreement “a fair resolution” based on the evidence and seriousness of the charges. He said Manfredonia will plead guilty in the second case on Feb. 16 and receive another 55-year sentence, to run concurrently with the sentence in the other case.Police and prosecutors said Manfredonia killed Ted DeMers, 62, and seriously wounded an 80-year-old man who lost several fingers and part of his ear in a Samurai sword attack in Willington on May 22, 2020.It's not clear why Manfredonia attacked the men. But an acquaintance of Manfredonia's lived near DeMers' home and told police she stopped seeing him recently.After the sword attack, police said Manfredonia broke into another man’s house in Willington and held him hostage for about 24 hours before taking off with his truck and firearms. The man later told police that Manfredonia told him “he just flipped.”Two days later, Manfredonia went to the Derby home of a high school friend, Nicholas Eisele, 23, and fatally shot him, authorities said. Manfredonia then forced Eisele's girlfriend into her car and fled the state, police said.After Manfredonia let the woman go near Columbia, New Jersey, investigators tracked him to Pennsylvania, where police said he took an Uber to a Walmart in East Stroudsburg. Authorities searched the area but didn’t find him. A man fitting his description was later spotted near Scranton, Pennsylvania, prompting another search there.Police believe Manfredonia stole a car and abandoned it in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, before taking another Uber to Hagerstown, Maryland, where he was captured without incident when police spotted him near a truck stop.Dolan, Manfredonia's lawyer, said Manfredonia was having mental health problems at the time and it was difficult for him to get help during the first months of the coronavirus pandemic.“His mental health issues weren’t being addressed and unfortunately he had a psychotic episode,” Dolan told The Associated Press Wednesday.",2023/2/9,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804590,Biden's fentanyl position sparks criticism from 2 sides,"President Joe Biden’s calls in his State of the Union speech for strong criminal penalties in response to soaring deaths linked to the potent opioid fentanyl are being rebuked by harm reduction advocates who say that approach could make the problem worse, even as some in Congress jeered the comments and blamed the Democrat’s border policies for deepening the crisis.

            The reactions laid bare how preventing drug deaths touches on deep political, practical and philosophical differences even in addressing an unrelenting U.S. overdose crisis connected to more than 100,000 deaths a year.

            After introducing a New Hampshire father whose 20-year-old daughter died eight years ago from a fentanyl overdose, Biden laid out a grim statistic: “Fentanyl is killing more than 70,000 Americans a year.”











            A few lawmakers called out “It’s the border."" The voice of one, Rep. Andy Ogles, a Tennessee Republican, rang out clearly: “It’s your fault!”

            Biden paused, smirked and went on, laying out his his approach for dealing with the crisis, including calling for inspecting more packages and cargo coming into the country.

            One phrase in particular — “strong penalties to crack down on fentanyl trafficking” — drew applause in the House chamber but criticism from harm reduction advocates working to contain the crisis. 

            While such advocates support other aspects of Biden's framework, their view is that handling the crisis largely as a law enforcement issue makes it worse, and that “strong penalties” could be linked to permanently listing fentanyl-related drugs in the highest tier of controlled substances. That brings higher penalties and make it harder for researchers to work with them. All fentanyl-related drugs are listed on that tier through 2024, but it's up to Congress to decide whether to make it permanent.

            “When you criminalize things, you create stigma around substances,” said Maritza Perez Medina, director of federal affairs at the Drug Policy Alliance. “If people know they're going to get in trouble for using substances, they're going to be reluctant to call for help.”

            Harry Cullen, an organizer with the harm reduction advocacy group P.A.I.N., said efforts to control the fentanyl supply have led the emergence of other, even more dangerous substances in the drug supply, such as Xylazine, which is used as a veterinarian sedative, and nitazenes, another class of opioids.

            “To double down on criminalization is not the way forward,” Cullen said.

            Harm reduction advocates call for increasing availability of medication-assisted treatment and measures to prevent fatal overdoses through measures such as providing supplies to test drugs for fentanyl, and naloxone, a drug that reverses opioid overdoses.

            Asked about disappointment from some public health advocates that Biden didn't roll out new treatment initiatives, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday that Washington “has more work to do.”

            The administration has advanced some efforts more than previous governments, such as allowing more federal money to be used for naloxone and making it easier to prescribe anti-addiction medications.

            Not everyone had criticism for Biden's approach. Anne Zink, the chief medical officer of the Alaska Department of Health and president of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, said in a statement that she welcomes his efforts to prevent overdoses, make access to treatment equitable and disrupt fentanyl trafficking.

            Among some Republicans, though, the overdose crisis is seen foremost as a border and law-enforcement issue.

            Fentanyl and related synthetic opioids are potent and can be transported in small amounts. When they first began having a major impact in the U.S. about a decade ago, they were largely being produced in labs in China and shipped into the country.

            Over time that has changed. Experts say most of the supply is now made in Mexico from chemicals imported from China. The drug is pressed into fake prescription pills and added to other illegal drugs. Officials say it is being brought to the U.S. mostly through legal ports of entry, eluding detection.

            Some who overdose on fentanyl don’t know they’re using it. But in other cases, drug users seek it out specifically.

            On Wednesday, 21 Republican state attorneys general wrote a letter to Biden and Secretary of State Andrew Blinken calling on them to designate Mexican drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. 

            “The same cartels who produce and traffic this dangerous chemical are also assassinating rivals and government officials, ambushing, and killing Americans at the border, and engaging in an armed insurgency against the Mexican government,” the letter said. “This dangerous terrorist activity occurring at our border will not abate unless we escalate our response.”

            Last year a group of Republican AGs requested the president declare fentanyl a weapon of mass destruction. No action has been taken.

            Regina LaBelle, who served as acting director of the National Drug Control Policy earlier in Biden's presidency, said the U.S. needs to deal with groups bringing fentanyl into the country. “These are transnational criminal organizations that traffic in people, fuel and drugs,” she said.

            But she warned: “If you focus only on that part of the issue, you're not doing your job.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804592,"Madrid beats Al Ahly 4-1, advances to Club World Cup final","RABAT, Morocco (AP) — Real Madrid secured its place in the Club World Cup final with a 4-1 win against Egyptian club Al Ahly on Wednesday to keep alive its quest for a record-extending eighth world title. 

            Vinícius Júnior, Federico Valverde, Rodrygo and Sergio Arribas scored for the Spanish side, which will play Al-Hilal in Saturday’s final. The Saudi Arabian team beat Brazilian club Flamengo 3-2 on Tuesday. 

            Madrid has won the world club title a record seven times, including three times when the competition was called the Intercontinental Cup. Madrid is chasing its first world club title since 2018.











            Ali Maaloul scored the lone goal for Al Ahly, with his team already trailing 2-0 in the second half. Vinícius opened the scoring in the 42nd minute for his 50th goal in 202 matches with Madrid. Valverde added to the lead early in the second half before Rodrygo and Arribas sealed the victory in stoppage time. It was the first goal for the 21-year-old Arribas with Madrid's first team.

            “We lowered the intensity and suffered a bit, but in the end we could manage it,” Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said. “We go into the final very motivated.”

            Madrid was without six injured players who did not travel to Morocco, including striker Karim Benzema, defender Éder Militão and goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois. 

            Ancelotti said Benzema and Militão will rejoin their teammates for the final, but Courtois, forward Eden Hazard and defenders Ferland Mendy and Lucas Vázquez are not going to make it.

            Madrid had been struggling recently, having won only two of its last seven matches in a stint that included defeat against rival Barcelona in the Spanish Super Cup final in Saudi Arabia.

            Madrid won the Club World Cup in 2014 — also in Morocco — and from 2016-2018. The other titles in 1960, 1998 and 2002 came in the Intercontinental Cup. 

            The last time a non-European team won the Club World Cup was in 2012, when Brazil’s Corinthians beat Chelsea 1-0 in Japan.

It was the first goal for the 21-year-old Arribas with Madrid's first team.“We lowered the intensity and suffered a bit, but in the end we could manage it,” Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said. “We go into the final very motivated.”Madrid was without six injured players who did not travel to Morocco, including striker Karim Benzema, defender Éder Militão and goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois.Ancelotti said Benzema and Militão will rejoin their teammates for the final, but Courtois, forward Eden Hazard and defenders Ferland Mendy and Lucas Vázquez are not going to make it.Madrid had been struggling recently, having won only two of its last seven matches in a stint that included defeat against rival Barcelona in the Spanish Super Cup final in Saudi Arabia.Madrid won the Club World Cup in 2014 — also in Morocco — and from 2016-2018. The other titles in 1960, 1998 and 2002 came in the Intercontinental Cup.The last time a non-European team won the Club World Cup was in 2012, when Brazil’s Corinthians beat Chelsea 1-0 in Japan.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/2/9,,World

            Mitchell Police Officer Christian Anderson was released from IU Health Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis, Lawrence County Sheriff Greg Day said in a post on Facebook.

            The other wounded officer, Lawrence County Sheriff’s Deputy Joshua Rhoades, left a hospital Sunday.











            “We pray for their continued healing,” Day said.

            Rhoades was shot twice and Anderson once on Sunday. Both officers fired at the suspect, identified by police as Anthony Richmond, 29, of West Baden Springs, who died at the scene in Mitchell, about 85 miles (137 kilometers) southwest of Indianapolis., according to Indiana State Police.

            
                Richmond fired several shots before he was killed, police said.

            Richmond fled on foot from officers as they were trying to handcuff him following the discovery of drugs in his car that had been stopped for a traffic violation, police said.

            When officers caught up with Richmond, he resisted arrest before he pulled out a handgun and fired at the officers “at point blank-range,” state police said Sunday in a news release.

            Either Rhoades or Anderson was able to return fire, killing Richmond, state police said.

(AP) — All-Star outfielder Kyle Tucker went to salary arbitration with the World Series champion Houston Astros on Wednesday, asking for $7.5 million rather than the team's $5 million offer.

            The $2.5 million gap matched the largest among 33 players who exchanged proposed salaries with their teams last month. The case was heard by John Stout, Fredric Horowitz and Jules Bloch, who are holding their decision until after additional cases.

            Tucker, 26, hit .257 with 30 homers, a career-best 107 RBIs and 25 stolen bases last year after batting .294 with 30 homers and 92 RBIs in 2021. He had a $764,200 salary last year and was eligible for arbitration for the first time.











            Astros right-hander Cristian Javier remains scheduled for a hearing. Also eligible for the first time, Javier has asked for a raise from $749,100 to $3.5 million and has been offered $3 million.

            Players and teams have split four decisions thus far. All-Star pitcher Max Fried ($13.5 million) lost to Atlanta and reliever Diego Castillo ($2.95 million) was defeated by Seattle, while pitcher Jesús Luzardo ($2.45 million) and AL batting champion Luis Arraez ($6.1 million) both beat the Marlins.

            Decisions also are pending for Tampa Bay relievers Colin Poche and Ryan Thompson, and for Los Angeles Angels outfielder Hunter Renfroe.

            Also Wednesday, utilityman Dylan Moore and the Seattle Mariners finalized a three-year contract worth $8,875,000, avoiding a hearing.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804596,Climate change protesters fined over 'Last Supper' protest,"LONDON (AP) — Five climate change protesters were fined Wednesday for gluing themselves to the frame of a copy of Leonardo da Vinci's “The Last Supper” in the Royal Academy of Arts. 

            The five activists from the group Just Stop Oil glued their hands to the painting's border and one sprayed graffiti on the wall at the London museum in July, as part of a series of disruptive protests aimed at raising awareness about climate change.

            On Wednesday, following a two-day trial, District Judge William Nelson ordered all five to pay 486 pounds ($587) each for criminal damage. He said the protesters were “reckless” because they knew they would damage the painting's frame — but also said that the “primary cause” of the protest “was to gain media attention and not to cause damage to a work of art.""











            The 16th-century painting, which was unharmed, is attributed to one or more of Da Vinci's pupils and is believed to be the most accurate record of the original.

            Just Stop Oil said it wanted to put pressure on Britain's government to halt new oil and gas licenses. In October, activists made international headlines when they threw tomato soup over Vincent van Gogh's “Sunflowers” at London's National Gallery. They caused no harm to the glass-covered painting.

            Other protesters from the group stormed the track at last year's British Grand Prix Formula 1 race.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804600,"Biden warns of GOP plans for Medicare, Social Security cuts","WASHINGTON (AP) — When President Joe Biden suggested that Republicans want to slash Medicare and Social Security, the GOP howls of protest during his State of the Union address showcased a striking apparent turnaround for the party that built a brand for years trying to do just that. 

            Biden is not about to let Republicans off easily and forget that history.

            The record ranges from President George W. Bush's ideas about privatizing Social Security to House Speaker Paul Ryan’s sweeping Medicare overhaul plan to current Sen. Rick Scott’s idea of allowing those and other federal programs to “sunset.""











            As budget negotiations move ahead, expect the long history of GOP efforts to slash the popular entitlement programs for seniors to remain a politically powerful weapon the White House intends to wield.

            “They sure didn’t like me calling them on it,” Biden said Wednesday about his address that drew heckling from Republicans the night before.

            He headed to political battleground Wisconsin, home of Republican Sen. Ron Johnson, who has proposed forcing Congress to authorize spending for Social Security every year.

            Speaking at a union training facility in DeForest, Biden pulled out a copy of Scott’s campaign proposals and quoted Johnson as well as Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah to warn that Republicans would target Social Security and Medicare.

            Referring to the loud GOP objections at the State of the Union, he said, “When I called them out on it last night, it sounded like they agreed to take these cuts off the table.”

            “Well, I sure hope that’s true,” he said. “I’ll believe it when I see it.""

            The political shift among Republicans is happening in real time, helping set the parameters for the budget negotiations as Biden and Congress try to come up with a plan for raising the nation’s debt limit by a summer deadline.

            House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has insisted that cuts to Medicare and Social Security are “off the table” — and many House and Senate Republicans vehemently agreed during Biden’s State of the Union address, some shouting “liar!” as he suggested they were proposing reductions.

            But it's unclear what Republicans will demand instead of entitlement cuts as they leverage the upcoming negotiations to extract federal spending reductions. They say they want to put the government on a path toward a balanced budget, but that’s a daunting if not impossible challenge without painful cuts elsewhere — in defense or other domestic accounts that Washington has been unable to make.

            Johnson accused the president of “lying” about the senator's approach. “I want to save these programs,” Johnson said in a statement Wednesday. ""We need a process to prioritize spending and decease our deficits.” 

            The White House has insisted that Republicans make their budget plans public for Americans to judge for themselves. That hasn't happened yet.

            ""No more saying one thing and doing another,” said White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre. “Let’s see exactly what they want to do.”

            Efforts to halt the explosive growth of the federal safety net programs for older Americans have stirred and stalled for years, particularly as the nation's population ages and more and more money is needed to shore up Medicare and Social Security. 

            Mandatory spending on the programs accounted for about $2.1 trillion in fiscal 2022, which ended last June 30 — a sizable chunk of the nation's $5.8 trillion federal budget. Both funds are on track for insolvency, and the nation's debt is climbing, already edging past the $31 trillion limit.

            In 2005, then President Bush floated a proposal to partially privatize Social Security, the retirement income program mostly for seniors. Republicans in 2010 seized control of the House and elevated House Budget Chairman Ryan, the architect of a Medicare proposal to shift toward a private insurance option, to be the party’s 2012 vice presidential nominee. More recently, Scott, leader of the Senate GOP’s campaign arm, put forward his own plans for overhauling the entitlement systems for older Americans. 

            Biden quickly zeroed in on Scott’s proposal when the senator first introduced it more than a year ago, using it to portray Republicans as extreme. White House officials credit that with helping Democrats hold onto the Senate in last fall's midterm elections. It’s a game-plan the president appears to be eager to deploy again as he gears up for a 2024 reelection bid.

            “Politically it was genius to tag the party with this idea that this party wants to do away with Social Security,” said William Arnone, chief executive of the National Academy of Social Insurance, an advocacy organization for Social Security. “The reaction from Republicans in the room is they want nothing to do with that idea.”

            Scott’s 12-point plan calls for all federal spending legislation to sunset in five years, subject to votes in Congress that could preserve programs.

            “If a law is worth keeping, Congress can pass it again,” Scott’s Rescue America website states. 

            Scott said in a written response to the president's State of the Union address that for Biden “to suggest that this means I want to cut Social Security or Medicare is a lie, and is a dishonest move.”

            “Does he think I also intend to get rid of the U.S. Navy? Or the border patrol? Or air traffic control, maybe?” Scott asked in the statement. “This is the kind of fake, gotcha BS that people hate about Washington. I’ve never advocated cutting Social Security or Medicare and never would.” 

            Scott's sunset ideas have a following among some Republicans in Congress, but at the same time the Republican Party is moving toward what appears to be a public unwillingness to touch the entitlement programs.

            Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has distanced the party from Scott’s ideas, and the Florida Republican lost an internal party bid to oust McConnell from leadership after the 2022 midterm elections.

            Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, the party's 2012 presidential nominee who chose Ryan as his running mate is proposing a bipartisan “Trust Act,” which would create a “Rescue Commission” for the nation's endangered trust funds with a mandate to come up with legislation that would extend their long-term solvency.

            Romney's plan, which is gaining traction among both Republicans and Democrats, is reminiscent of the 2010 bipartisan National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, otherwise known as the Bowles-Simpson commission. Headed by two former Democratic and Republican lawmakers. it proposed one of the most sweeping overhauls yet of the nation's entitlement and budget programs.

            Those recommendations proved politically toxic, and the Obama administration quickly distanced itself, as did many members of Congress.

            During the last debt ceiling go-around, in 2011, Biden, as Obama's vice president, helped broker deals to ease the standoff. Among the ideas? A bipartisan “Super Committee” to propose budget cuts.

            It, too, was unable to have political staying power, and the cuts were never fully put in place.WASHINGTON (AP) — When President Joe Biden suggested that Republicans want to slash Medicare and Social Security, the GOP howls of protest during his State of the Union address showcased a striking apparent turnaround for the party that built a brand for years trying to do just that.Biden is not about to let Republicans off easily and forget that history.The record ranges from President George W.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804603,Reus fires Dortmund into German Cup QFs with win in Bochum,"BOCHUM, Germany (AP) — Substitute Marco Reus needed just three minutes to fire Borussia Dortmund into the quarterfinals of the German Cup with a 2-1 win at local rival Bochum on Wednesday.

            Reus entered the game in the 67th minute and scored the winning goal in the 70th, tapping the ball into the unguarded net after unselfish play from Jude Bellingham to set him up.

            That goal came three minutes after Kevin Stöger had equalized from the penalty spot for Bochum.











            Dortmund defender Emre Can opened the scoring just before the break by scoring from his own half. Bochum goalkeeper Manuel Riemann emerged far from goal near the sideline to make a clearance ahead of Sébastien Haller. The ball landed over the halfway line in the center circle where Can saw his chance and aimed for the empty net. Can waited to see the ball go in despite a desperate chase by the goalkeeper.

            Dortmund also needed Gregor Kobel at his best to deny the home team, with Bochum’s forwards carving out several opportunities only to be thwarted by the Swiss goalkeeper.

            Their perseverance finally paid off when Dortmund forward Jamie Bynoe-Gittens was penalized for handball for blocking Anthony Losilla’s shot with his arm. After a long VAR review, Stöger equalized from the spot.

            Reus then restored the visitors’ lead and Dortmund withstood intense pressure to progress.

            “Sometimes when you play a good game you don't win the match,” Losilla said. “But we can proud of the game we played.” 

            Nuremberg earlier advanced by beating second-division rival Fortuna Düsseldorf 5-3 on penalties after the match finished 1-1.

After a long VAR review, Stöger equalized from the spot.Reus then restored the visitors’ lead and Dortmund withstood intense pressure to progress.“Sometimes when you play a good game you don't win the match,” Losilla said. “But we can proud of the game we played.”Nuremberg earlier advanced by beating second-division rival Fortuna Düsseldorf 5-3 on penalties after the match finished 1-1.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/2/9,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804605,2 US Army veterans deported to Mexico win US citizenship,"SAN DIEGO (AP) — After fighting in Afghanistan, former U.S. Army soldier Mauricio Hernandez Mata returned home with post-traumatic stress, which he says eventually led to getting in trouble with the law and being deported to Mexico — a country he had not lived in since he was a boy.

            On Wednesday, he and another deported veteran were sworn in as U.S. citizens at a special naturalization ceremony in San Diego. 

            The two veterans were among 65 who have been allowed back into the United States over the past year ago as part of a growing effort by the Biden administration called the Immigrant Military Members and Veterans Initiative to make amends with immigrants who served in the U.S. military only to wind up deported. 











            Hundreds of U.S. military veterans, including some who were charged with crimes such as drunk driving or theft, have been deported over the years in what immigration advocates and others have called an unfair punishment to those who took up arms in the name of the United States. Many are still struggling to find legal help to return, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. 

            “After my deportation, yeah, I never thought this day would come,” said Hernandez, 41, dressed in a black suit and tie after being presented his U.S. citizenship certificate. “It's definitely been a long road. I'm glad that we were given a second chance as anybody that is either American-born or fought for America should have.”

            Leonel Contreras, 63, who joined the U.S. Army at age of 17 and served for a year in 1976, also was sworn in at the ceremony. 

            “I feel very blessed,” said Contreras, who was allowed back into the United States about four months ago. “I feel very happy to be back on American soil.”

            Both men spent the past decade living in the border city of Tijuana. 

            Contreras was whisked away by U.S. immigration authorities who detained him at the barbershop where he worked in National City, south of San Diego. His life forever changed.

            He continued to work in Tijuana as a barber and found work because of his English at call centers helping answer questions from customers of U.S. companies. But it was not easy.

            During that time his two sons grew up, and he now is a grandfather. With his U.S. citizenship in hand, he said he is not looking back.

            “I just want to go to all the places I've dreamed of seeing, like the Grand Canyon and possibly Mount Rushmore,” he said. 

            Hernandez said his deportation came after unspecified “irreverent actions and mistakes I made due to my PTSD.” He declined to give more details. But he said after he was allowed back into the country a year ago, he was determined to get his U.S. citizenship to be able to go to the grocery store and not feel “terrified” of being picked up and sent back to Mexico. 

            His 7-year-old daughter hugged him after he was sworn in amid cheers from a crowd that included more than a dozen veterans from various branches. Then he turned and kissed his wife. 

            “I've always been an American, the difference is now I'm an American citizen and I have all the rights that any American born citizen has,” Hernandez said. “And it was important to me to have those rights just to prove the point, the point being that anybody that's willing to lay down their life, their sanity, and give everything that they hold dear for American freedom should be eventually at one point in their lives considered a U.S. citizen.”SAN DIEGO (AP) — After fighting in Afghanistan, former U.S. Army soldier Mauricio Hernandez Mata returned home with post-traumatic stress, which he says eventually led to getting in trouble with the law and being deported to Mexico — a country he had not lived in since he was a boy.On Wednesday, he and another deported veteran were sworn in as U.S. citizens at a special naturalization ceremony in San Diego.The two veterans were among 65 who have been allowed back into the United States over the past year ago as part of a growing effort by the Biden administration called the Immigrant Military Members and Veterans Initiative to make amends with immigrants who served in the U.S. military only to wind up deported.Hundreds of U.S. military veterans, including some who were charged with crimes such as drunk driving or theft, have been deported over the years in what immigration advocates and others have called an unfair punishment to those who took up arms in the name of the United States.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804606,"Opal Lee, 'grandmother of Juneteenth,' gets Texas portrait","AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Opal Lee, the 96-year-old Texan whose efforts helped make Juneteenth a federal holiday to commemorate the end of slavery in the U.S., became on Wednesday only the second Black person whose portrait will hang in the senate chamber of the state Capitol. 

            Lawmakers gave a lengthy standing ovation for Lee, who two years ago stood next to President Joe Biden as Juneteenth officially became the first new federal holiday since Martin Luther King Jr. Day was created in 1983. She had organized walks in cities across the U.S. as part of her campaign to have June 19 recognized as a federal holiday.

            Lee was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize in 2022.











            Her painting will join those of other celebrated Texas figures on the walls of the 135-year-old Capitol, where nearly a dozen Confederate markers remain in and around the building. Lee, who is from Fort Worth and often called the “ grandmother of Juneteenth,” joins the late U.S. Rep. Barbara Jordan as the only two Black Texans to have portraits in the Senate chamber. 

            Jordan's portrait was hung in 1973. 

            “Change somebody’s mind because minds can be changed,” Lee told reporters after the ceremony. “If people have been taught to hate they can be taught to love, and it is up to you to do it.”

            Juneteenth commemorates June 19, 1865, when Union soldiers brought the news of freedom to enslaved Black people in Galveston, Texas — two months after the Confederacy had surrendered. That was also about 2 1/2 years after the Emancipation Proclamation freed slaves in the Southern states.

            Lee, who began her advocacy to make Juneteenth a holiday at the age of 89, was lauded by senators from both parties who took turns praising her tenacity and legacy. Among them was state Sen. Royce West, a Democrat who is one of two Black senators in the 31-member chamber.

            Opponents of Confederate monuments at the state Capitol have fought to remove them for years, and West said there still needs to be a discussion about which portraits were “appropriate” to remain in the state's senate chamber and which should be in a museum's collection. 

            “You can't hide from the history of this state,” West said. 

            Rosalind Roland, 62, was among the lively crowd gathered in the upstairs gallery to watch the unveiling. She said her family has organized Juneteenth celebrations for 150 years, but that last year was the first time they celebrated it as an official national holiday, thanks to Lee's work. 

            “This is probably the biggest Black history moment I am going to ever have,” Roland said. 

            Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, a Republican who leads the senate, told Lee when she visited the Capitol in 2021 that her portrait should be hanging on the walls of the chamber. After the unveiling Wednesday, Lee said she wanted “to do a whole dance” the moment she saw the portrait, which was painted by Texas artist Jess Coleman. 

            “It was beautiful,"" she said. ""I didn’t know I looked that good.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804607,Air near Ohio derailment safe for residents to return home,"EAST PALESTINE, Ohio (AP) — Evacuated residents can return to the Ohio village where crews burned toxic chemicals after a train derailed five days ago near the Pennsylvania state line now that monitors show no dangerous levels in the air, authorities said Wednesday.

            Around-the-clock testing inside and outside the evacuation zone around the village of East Palestine and a sliver of Pennsylvania showed the air had returned to normal levels that would have been seen before the derailment, said James Justice of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

            “Hundreds and hundreds of data points we’ve collected over the time show the air quality is safe,"" he said.











            Residents were ordered to evacuate when authorities decided on Monday to release and burn five tankers filled with vinyl chloride, sending hydrogen chloride and the toxic gas phosgene into the air. 

            Monitors did detect toxins in the air during the controlled burn at the derailment site, but other samples outside that area did not, Justice said. 

            The village's mayor expressed relief that the evacuation had been lifted.

            “We know everybody’s frustrated. Everybody wants to be in their homes. We did the best we can,"" said Mayor Trent Conaway. “The number one goal is public safety, and we accomplished that. Nobody was injured, nobody died.” 

            He credited the village’s part-time firefighters and their quick response to the derailment for saving the town.

            Some residents have said they were worried about returning even if authorities say it's OK to go home despite reassurances from officials. 

            It’s unlikely though, Justice said, that there be would any dangerous levels of toxins inside any homes or businesses based on readings from air monitors around the community. 

            Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said some residents may want to wait until their homes are checked. Rail operator Norfolk Southern Railway said it would provide testing and continue to operate its family assistance center “for the foreseeable future.” 

            “It’s very understandable you may want that testing done before you go back in your house,” DeWine said. 

            The governor said the railroad will have to pay for the cleanup and make sure something like this doesn't happen again. “The burden is upon them is to assure the public that what they do everyday is safe,” DeWine said. 

            Testing on rivers, streams and drinking water wells will continue throughout the area and in the nearby Ohio River.

            Kurt Kollar, a representative from the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, said contaminants from the derailed tanker cars spilled into some waterways and were toxic to fish, but he added that data so far indicates the drinking water was protected. 

            The fire from the chemical release is no longer burning, and crews have started removing some of the wreckage. 

            About 50 cars, including 10 carrying hazardous materials, derailed in a fiery crash Friday night on the edge of East Palestine. Federal investigators say a mechanical issue with a rail car axle caused the derailment.

            No injuries have been reported from the derailment or from the controlled release of the chemicals, but some people complained about smelling chlorine and smoke in the air and having headaches. 

            At least one lawsuit has been filed over the derailment. An East Palestine business owner and two other residents sued Norfolk Southern in federal court on Tuesday, alleging negligence by the company and exposure to toxic substances as a result. They’re seeking to make it a class-action case for residents and businesses in the evacuated area and people who were physically harmed because of spilled chemicals at the site.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804614,"NFL Commissioner Goodell tackles diversity, concussions","PHOENIX (AP) — From diversity to concussions, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell reiterated the league is still looking for improvement.

            As for officiating, he says: “it’s never been better.”

            Goodell addressed those topics and more, including the Washington Commanders’ investigation, flex scheduling and international play in his annual Super Bowl news conference Wednesday.











            DeMeco Ryans became the NFL’s third Black head coach when Houston hired the former Pro Bowl linebacker and 49ers defensive coordinator. Ryans joined Pittsburgh’s Mike Tomlin and Tampa Bay’s Todd Bowles. There are three other minority coaches, including Miami’s Mike McDaniel, who has a Black father and identifies as biracial.

            The Titans hired Ran Carthon, the league’s eighth Black general manager and ninth person of color overall. 

            “I still feel like there’s better work and more work ahead of us,” Goodell said. “I think there’s progress and we’re pleased to see progress but there’s never enough. We look to see how we can make things better.”

            Player safety is always a hot topic in the NFL. Concussions were magnified and the league revised its protocols during the season after criticism for the way Tua Tagovailoa’s head injuries were handled. 

            The NFL announced last week concussions had increased by 18 percent during the regular season. Goodell attributed the rise to the updated diagnostic measures. 

            “I think that’s a reason why concussions went up this year, because we had a broader definition,” Goodell said. “If you have more evaluations you’re going to have more concussions. Any time we can change the protocols to make it safer for our players, we’re going to do that. We’re not afraid of having them diagnosed. That’s important to us and why we encourage players to come forward when they have symptoms so we can make sure they are handled properly.”

            Overall, Goodell said injuries are down 6% this year. He said injuries for Thursday games and for the additional Week 18 games are no different than any other time during the season.

            “You want to take the head out of the game,” Goodell said. “You’re always going to have contacts that are not intended, so that’s why we have protections, but ultimately you want to have rules that are avoiding the techniques that lead to these kinds of injuries.”

            NFLPA executive director DeMaurice Smith pointed out the league and the players’ union have, since 2009, instituted return to-play protocols, brought in sideline concussion experts, revamped health and safety standards and made it a requirement for team doctors to comply with all federal and state guidelines.

            “This has been a relentless effort to constantly improve safety,” Smith said.

            Quality of NFL officiating has been scrutinized, especially in the playoffs. There was heavy criticism early in the season regarding roughing-the-passer penalties. 

            “When you look at officiating, I don’t think it’s ever been better in the league,” Goodell said. “There are over 42,000 plays in a season and multiple infractions could occur on any play. Take that out, extrapolate that. That’s hundreds, if not millions, of potential fouls. Our officials do an extraordinary job of getting those. Are there mistakes in the context of that? Yes. They are not perfect and officiating never will (be).”

            ___

            COMMANDERS

            Goodell said there’s no timeline for Mary Jo White to complete her ongoing investigation into allegations of misconduct by the owner Daniel Snyder. Goodell has said the report will be made public. Snyder and wife Tanya in early November hired a firm to explore possible transactions related to the team so it’s possible the Commanders will be sold.

            “The Commanders are under a process. That’s their process,” Goodell said. “Ultimately, if they reach a conclusion and have someone joining the ownership group or buying the team, that’s something the ownership will look at.”

            ___

            FLEX SCHEDULING

            Goodell said Monday night games will be subject to flex scheduling next season. He added it’s possible Thursday night games also could be flexed at some point in the future. 

            ___

            INTERNATIONAL PLAY

            The NFL played its first regular-season game in Germany this season and five teams will play home games in Germany and London in 2023. The league will return to Mexico in 2024 after stadium renovation.

            While Netflix won’t say when paid sharing will come to other countries, some version of the plan is expected to be introduced in the U.S. in the next few weeks. Around one-third of Netflix's subscribers live in the U.S. and Canada.











            Netflix has more than 231 million paid subscribers in 190 countries. The Los Gatos, California-based company estimates that 100 million households are currently sharing their accounts with others, which impacts the company’s ability to invest in new programming.

            “We’ve always made it easy for people who live together to share their Netflix account with features like profiles and multiple streams,"" the company said in a blog post Wednesday. “While these have been hugely popular, they’ve also created confusion about when and how you can share Netflix.""

            Starting Wednesday, Netflix said it will allow standard and premium subscribers in Canada, Spain, New Zealand and Portugal to set up an extra account for up to two people they don’t live with for an extra monthly fee. The monthly fee varies by country; in Canada, it’s 7.99 Canadian dollars, while in Portugal it’s 3.99 euros.

            Netflix said it will also allow people who have been borrowing accounts to transfer their viewing history and other preferences to a new, paid subscription.

            Netflix didn’t say what actions it will take if subscribers continue to share accounts outside their household. In a conference call with investors in January, Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters said the company is trying to be thoughtful and gradual in its rollout.

            “It’s worth noting that this will not be a universally popular move, so there will current members that are unhappy with this move. We’ll see a bit of a cancel reaction to that,” he said. “We think of this as similar to what we see when we raise prices.”Netflix has a plan to deal with rampant account sharing: a program that lets subscribers pay extra to share their account with people outside their household.The streaming giant introduced paid sharing in Canada, New Zealand, Portugal and Spain on Wednesday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804616,Man United stages fightback to draw 2-2 with Leeds in EPL,"MANCHESTER, England (AP) — Manchester United fought back from a two-goal deficit to draw 2-2 with Leeds in the Premier League on Wednesday.

            Substitute Jadon Sancho rescued a point for Erik ten Hag's team, which missed the chance to move level on points with second-place Manchester City. 

            Leeds fired Jesse Marsch on Monday. It is still waiting for a first win in the league since Nov. 5, but moved a point clear of the relegation zone. 











            Both teams, however, will feel they missed the opportunity to take more from the thrilling match at Old Trafford.

            Leeds stunned the home crowd by taking the lead after just 55 seconds through Wilfried Gnonto and looked on course for victory when Raphael Varane deflected Crysencio Summerville’s cross into his own net three minutes after halftime. 

            United got back into the game through Marcus Rashford's header in the 62nd and Sancho equalized in the 70th. 

            But on a night when United was looking to cut the gap on leader Arsenal to five points, it remains seven behind the London club having played two more games.

            The double-header against Leeds looked like an ideal opportunity for the hosts to continue their charge toward the top of the table, with the sides facing each other again in the league at Elland Road on Sunday. 

            Leeds turned up without a manager and without a win in the league for three months. 

            But under an interim management trio of Chris Armas, Michael Skubala and Paco Gallardo, it threatened an upset against in-form United.

            Ten Hag had his own issues to contend with as he tried to cope with a number of key absences including the injured Christian Eriksen and Antony, as well as the suspended Casemiro. 

            As a result United looked light in midfield and attack, even with loan signing Marcel Sabitzer making his first start since joining from Bayern Munich on transfer deadline day. 

            Leeds exposed the home team’s frailties almost straight from kickoff with Gnonto firing a low shot past David de Gea at the end of a driving run toward the box inside the opening minute. 

            United had chances to even the score before halftime, with Alejandro Garnacho rounding Leeds goalkeeper Illan Meslier before seeing his shot headed off the line by Maximillian Wober. Varane then saw his header saved by Meslier, who pushed another effort from Sabitzer over the bar. 

            Leeds scored three minutes into the second half when substitute Summerville’s cross was turned in by Varane. 

            Ten Hag sent on Sancho and Facundo Pellistri in an attempt to mount a comeback and it had the desired effect. 

            Rashford moved into the center forward position and pulled a goal back with a header three minutes after the changes. 

            Brenden Aaronson hit the post with a free kick, but Sancho evened the score with a low curling shot through a crowded box.

            Varane had another header pushed over by Meslier as the crowd roared United on, but both teams had to settle for a draw.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804617,"Arkansas Gov. Sanders proposes raises, vouchers in bill","LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) — Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders proposed on Wednesday an overhaul of the state's schools that will pair a 39% raise in starting teacher pay with a new voucher program that will direct public money to pay for private and home schooling.

            Sanders also said the bill, which she's called her priority in this year's legislative session, will include limits on how race and sex are taught in schools. Sanders outlined the details of the legislation a day after the former White House press secretary delivered the Republican rebuttal to President Joe Biden's State of the Union Address.

            “This is the most substantial overhaul of our state's education system in Arkansas history, and frankly, it couldn't come soon enough,"" Sanders said at a news conference at the state Capitol with Republican lawmakers. “The longer we wait to reform our failing schools, the more future generations we're condemning to a lifetime of poverty.""











            Sanders' proposal calls for raising starting teacher salaries in the state from $36,000 a year to $50,000. The move follows calls by lawmakers from both parties to raise the starting pay, which is one of the lowest in the country. 

            Sanders' proposal includes a laundry list of initiatives opposed by Democrats and teachers' advocacy groups, including an “education freedom account"" for private and home schooling that she said will be phased in over three years. The accounts will be equal to about 90% of the state's per-student funding for public schools, which is currently about $7,300.

            Similar statewide savings account programs exist in Arizona and West Virginia, and they've been proposed in a dozen other states this year. 

            Sanders said the bill will put into law an executive order she signed hours after taking office last month that prohibited public schools from teaching critical race theory. The governor said the legislation will also include restrictions similar to a Florida law that forbids instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through third grade. Critics have called that measure Florida's “Don't Say Gay"" law.

            Democrats, who have proposed a standalone teacher raise bill, said the increase should be considered separately rather than attached to other initiatives backed by Republicans. 

            “You lump everything into that kind of a bill and even if there are some things we'd like to support or could support, we just can't do it because we believe the voucher part of it is going to be a systematic dismantling of the public school system in Arkansas,"" Democratic Rep. Tippi McCullough, the House minority leader, told reporters. 

            The proposal also faces resistance from some Republicans who have expressed concerns about the impact diverting public money to private schools could have.

            “What we're going to do is we're going to create a system of have and have-nots,"" Republican Rep. Jim Wooten, who has opposed past “school choice"" efforts. Wooten said he supports raises for teachers and would rather vote on it separately.

            Supporters of the measure defended combining all of the proposals into one omnibus bill.

            “If you piecemeal it out in several different bills and some of those bills don't pass, then you don't have comprehensive education reform,"" said Republican Sen. Breanne Davis, who will be the lead Senate sponsor of the legislation. 

            The bill has yet to be filed, so many details remain unknown. Sanders' office later said other parts of the legislation would repeal the Teacher Fair Dismissal Act and provide for 12 weeks of paid maternity leave.

            Sanders said the package will cost $300 million in the first year, with half of that new spending.

            Sanders said the bill will also include student loan forgiveness for new teachers who commit to teach in areas of highest need, and up to $10,000 in performance-based bonuses. She also proposed new programs aimed at improving literacy, including sending 120 “reading coaches"" to schools and $500 tutoring grants for students not meeting reading benchmarks in kindergarten through 3rd grade.LITTLE ROCK, Ark.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804618,Jury may not hear cops' admissions in Tyre Nichols’ beating,"It was a stunning revelation: One of the officers involved in the fatal beating of Tyre Nichols took a cellphone photo of the bloodied and handcuffed man and shared it with five other people.

            The disclosure was part of the Memphis Police Department's request to the state that the five former officers charged with murder in Nichols' death be decertified. But the officer's statement about sharing the photo will likely never be seen by a jury. 

            So-called “Garrity statements” — or disclosures made by police officers during internal investigations under the threat of termination if they stay silent — have been viewed by courts as compelled and therefore cannot be used in criminal court. 











            Six officers already have been fired and one more has been relieved of duty after Nichols was pulled over for an alleged traffic violation and beaten by police. Six others could receive administrative discipline, officials disclosed, without providing any details. Prosecutors say the Jan. 7 arrest, which was captured on police video cameras, led to Nichols’ death three days later. 

            Here’s a look at “Garrity statements” and other aspects of internal police investigations into misconduct the public rarely sees: 

            ____

            WHAT IS A GARRITY STATEMENT? 

            When a police officer is accused of misconduct, internal police investigators who are trying to figure out what happened often take statements from the accused officers or witnesses. Officers — like everyone — have a Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and can't be forced to fess up to potential misconduct just to have those statements later used against them in a criminal case. 

            “Police officers do not shed their Constitutional rights when they pin on a badge,” said Phil Stinson, a criminologist at Bowling Green State University who tracks charges and convictions of police officers, and also a former police officer.

            If an officer is told they have to answer questions as part of an internal affairs investigation or they could lose their job, courts have viewed those statements as protected or inadmissible in criminal proceedings because the officers were forced to talk. 

            They are called “Garrity statements"" because of a 1967 U.S. Supreme Court decision in a case titled Garrity v. New Jersey that involved police officers who were brought in for questioning over allegations of traffic ticket fixing. The officers were warned that if they didn’t answer questions they would lose their job. Some of their answers were later used against them in court and they were convicted. The Supreme Court said such statements are involuntary, so they can't be used in criminal proceedings. 

            That doesn't mean that an officer who gives a compelled statement to internal affairs investigators cannot be criminally prosecuted. While those statements would not be part of the criminal case, prosecutors would be able to present other evidence, such as the videos that show the brutal beating. The cellphone photos may also still be seen by jurors if prosecutors can get the information through other means, Stinson said. 

            “Somebody who received the photo may come forward, or prosecutors may get this information through other sources independent of this material,” Stinson said. “But I think any good defense attorney would raise a Garrity challenge.”

            Officials have to be careful to keep the internal affairs and criminal investigations totally separate because it can derail the criminal case if the prosecution is found to have inappropriately used statements protected under Garrity. 

            “The violation of the Garrity protections can come at a very high cost to a subsequent prosecution,” said Bill Johnson, executive director and general counsel of the National Association of Police Organizations. 

            But while an officer's own Garrity statement can't be used against them in their criminal case, prosecutors can use that officer's statement to build a case against a fellow officer, Johnson said. 

            WHAT DID THE MEMPHIS OFFICERS SAY? 

            Documents released by the Tennessee Peace Officers Standards and Training Commission on Tuesday say that officer Officer Demetrius Haley took two photos “while standing in front of the obviously injured subject after he was handcuffed.” Haley admitted in his Garrity statement that he shared a photo in a text message with five people, according to the papers. 

            Officer Desmond Mills said in his Garrity statement that he struck Nichols three times with a baton and deployed pepper spray twice because “officers were unable to handcuff him,"" the documents say. The records say Mills admitted that he didn't “provide immediate medical aid and walked away and decontaminated"" himself ""from chemical irritant spray.” 

            Another officer, Tadarrius Bean, admitted in his compelled statement that he struck the man “with a closed fist two to three times in the face” because he and his partners were “unable to handcuff him,” the documents say. 

            The officer's Garrity statements were “not consistent with one another” and “not consistent with the publicly known injuries and death of Mr. Nichols,” the papers say. 

            HOW HAVE GARRITY STATEMENTS PLAYED A ROLE IN OTHER CASES? 

            Former Balch Springs, Texas, police officer Roy Oliver raised concerns about Garrity materials in appealing his murder conviction and 15-year sentence in the 2017 shooting death of 15-year-old Jordan Edwards while the teen was leaving a high school party.

            Oliver’s attorneys claimed that Garrity materials had been shared with the prosecutor’s office, that all interviews in the days after the case should have been considered exempted under Garrity and the whole case should have been thrown out.

            Oliver had given three interviews during the investigation, one to a Balch Springs investigator, a second walk-through interview at the scene initiated by Dallas police investigators who had taken over the criminal investigation of the shooting, and a third filmed interview with a Balch Springs internal investigator.

            Both a lower court and an appeals court found that Dallas Police investigators, who conducted a walk-through interview, had clearly identified themselves as investigating the criminal case around the shooting not an internal affairs issue when they asked Oliver for the interview. They also noted Oliver had not shown that any testimony had been tainted by Garrity protected materials, which had been siloed off by a prosecutor’s office staffer and not given to prosecutors. 

            In Utah, prosecutors have seen an increase in officers declining to talk to prosecutors or criminal investigators, meaning they often have to infer from other testimony or camera footage if the officer felt threatened or acted within the law when using fatal force. In one of those cases, the 2018 fatal shooting of 19-year-old Zane James, prosecutors declined to charge Cottonwood Heights officer Casey Davies.

            But a federal judge ruled that James’ family can use Davies’ Garrity statements in a civil lawsuit, despite objections from Davies’ attorney that there is no statute of limitations on murder charges and the statements could be used in a criminal case. 

            The family claims that Davies’ statement directly contradicts the police department’s narrative about their son’s death, specifically that he had crashed his motorcycle when Davies said in his interview that he had rammed the motorcycle with his car after believing James was reaching for a gun. 

            WHAT ABOUT OTHER PARTS OF INTERNAL INVESTIGATIONS? 

            Garrity statements aren’t the only aspects of internal affairs investigations that rarely reach the public eye. Police unions are increasingly negotiating time limits on disciplinary histories for officers as part of union contracts, meaning in some places information about a disciplinary record becomes no longer releasable in public information requests as little as two years after the complaint.

            Other states keep any disciplinary findings that don’t result in a firing, or in some cases a suspension, from public view.

            In most cases, at least the results of internal affairs investigations of officers are supposed to be available to prosecutors and to defense attorneys seeking discovery. But the different rules for public release have meant more mistakes in some departments on what files are sent to those entities as well.

            In Philadelphia, District Attorney Larry Krasner filed motions in 2021 to hold police department officials in contempt for failing to turn over complete disciplinary histories of officers. In one case, prosecutors noted 16 cases involving a Philadelphia police officer who had been found in internal investigations to have falsified documents. But because the information was not disclosed in answer to requests by prosecutors, they could not disclose it in discovery to defense attorneys.

            Police and prosecutors agreed before a court hearing to work toward a settlement.

In one of those cases, the 2018 fatal shooting of 19-year-old Zane James, prosecutors declined to charge Cottonwood Heights officer Casey Davies.But a federal judge ruled that James’ family can use Davies’ Garrity statements in a civil lawsuit, despite objections from Davies’ attorney that there is no statute of limitations on murder charges and the statements could be used in a criminal case.The family claims that Davies’ statement directly contradicts the police department’s narrative about their son’s death, specifically that he had crashed his motorcycle when Davies said in his interview that he had rammed the motorcycle with his car after believing James was reaching for a gun.WHAT ABOUT OTHER PARTS OF INTERNAL INVESTIGATIONS?Garrity statements aren’t the only aspects of internal affairs investigations that rarely reach the public eye. Police unions are increasingly negotiating time limits on disciplinary histories for officers as part of union contracts, meaning in some places information about a disciplinary record becomes no longer releasable in public information requests as little as two years after the complaint.Other states keep any disciplinary findings that don’t result in a firing, or in some cases a suspension, from public view.In most cases, at least the results of internal affairs investigations of officers are supposed to be available to prosecutors and to defense attorneys seeking discovery. But the different rules for public release have meant more mistakes in some departments on what files are sent to those entities as well.In Philadelphia, District Attorney Larry Krasner filed motions in 2021 to hold police department officials in contempt for failing to turn over complete disciplinary histories of officers. In one case, prosecutors noted 16 cases involving a Philadelphia police officer who had been found in internal investigations to have falsified documents. But because the information was not disclosed in answer to requests by prosecutors, they could not disclose it in discovery to defense attorneys.Police and prosecutors agreed before a court hearing to work toward a settlement.___For more coverage of the Tyre Nichols case, go to apnews.com/hub/tyre-nichols",2023/2/9,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804621,Zoo too? Houston Zoo latest to deal with suspicious incident,"HOUSTON (AP) — Police are investigating possible vandalism at the Houston Zoo after workers discovered that someone had deliberately cut a four-inch gap in the mesh that covers a habitat for brown pelicans. 

            The damage to the habitat comes after a series of thefts and incidents of vandalism at other zoos around the country, including the theft of two monkeys from the Dallas Zoo. 

            After workers at the Houston Zoo discovered the cut in the mesh on Monday, they searched the area and found the animals inside were secure and safe, the zoo said in a statement Wednesday.











            “The gap appears to be the result of vandalism. Out of an abundance of caution, all other animal areas were closely examined, and nothing similar was found,” the zoo said. 

            Houston police were called to the zoo Monday afternoon to take an initial report, said police spokesman Victor Senties. 

            The police department’s property and financial crimes division is handling the case but it was still “pretty early in the investigation,” Senties said. 

            “We will not tolerate the theft or endangerment of any of our animals, big or small,” the zoo said.

            
                In Dallas, Davion Irvin was jailed after being charged in the theft of two emperor tamarin monkeys from the city’s zoo on Jan. 29. The monkeys were found safe two days later in an empty home in suburban Dallas.

            Irvin also faces a burglary charge related to the escape of a clouded leopard named Nova, who was discovered missing Jan. 13. A cut was found in her enclosure, and the Dallas Zoo closed as a search was launched. She was found later that day near her habitat.

            Police in Louisiana announced the arrest Tuesday of a 61-year-old man in the case of 12 squirrel monkeys discovered missing Jan. 29 from their enclosure at Zoosiana in Broussard, about 60 miles (100 kilometers) west of Baton Rouge. Police said the monkeys remain missing.

            In New York, officials were still trying to recapture Flaco, a Eurasian eagle-owl, which escaped from the Central Park Zoo on Feb. 2 after someone had vandalized its exhibit.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804624,Owl who escaped from zoo is NYC's latest avian celebrity,"NEW YORK (AP) — An owl who escaped from the Central Park Zoo after someone damaged his cage has become New York City's latest avian celebrity, attracting gawkers as he surveys the park from one tall tree or another but stoking fears that he can't hunt and will starve.

            The owl, a Eurasian eagle-owl named Flaco, escaped Feb. 2, zoo spokesperson Max Pulsinelli said in a news release the following day. “The exhibit had been vandalized and the stainless steel mesh cut,” Pulsinelli said. “Upon notification, a team was mobilized to search for the bird.”

            Flaco flew from the zoo to the nearby shopping hub of Fifth Avenue, where police officers tried to catch him and failed.











            He returned to Central Park the next morning and since then has been spotted at various locations in the southeast section of the park. Flaco has spent part of his time on the grounds of the zoo he fled, but he has not returned to captivity on his own.

            Zoo officials said last week that they were seeking to recapture Flaco, but they have not issued any updates on their efforts since then.

            No one has seen Flaco eat during his six days on the lam, said David Barrett, who runs birding Twitter accounts including Manhattan Bird Alert, Brooklyn Bird Alert and Bronx Bird Alert.

            Wednesday found Flaco commanding a view of Wollman Rink's ice skaters from an oak tree in the park's Hallett Nature Sanctuary. A small crowd watched from a respectful distance.

            “I just want to observe how he's doing myself,"" retired health care worker Gig Palileo said as she examined the owl through her camera lens. “I’m a nurse, so I’m always kind of like, ‘Is the eyes still alert?’” 

            Palileo said she was saddened “that somebody had let this guy go without even thinking what’s the consequences. ... Probably he doesn’t know how to hunt."" 

            Kenny Cwiok, a retired correction officer in the state prison system, was more sanguine about the owl's survival in the wild. “I think he can survive,” Kwiok said. “If he learned how to fly I guess he can learn how to hunt.”

            Kwiok called Flaco “a celebrity” like the brightly plumaged Mandarin duck that dazzled park-goers a few years ago. “He was a star,” Kwiok said. “He was a Brad Pitt for Central Park.”

            The Eurasian eagle-owl is one of the larger owl species with a wingspan of up to 79 inches (2 meters), according to the Wildlife Conservation Society. They have large talons and distinctive ear tufts.

            Like the Mandarin duck, the Eurasian eagle-owl is not native to North America, but native owl species including great horned owls and barred owls do frequent Central Park, where they dine on rats, mice and smaller birds.

            Dustin Partridge, director of conservation and science for NYC Audubon, said he hopes Flaco's plight raises awareness of the fugitive bird's wild cousins. “There's a lot of owl life in the city,” Partridge said. “If you've never seen an owl, they're majestic creatures.”NEW YORK (AP) — An owl who escaped from the Central Park Zoo after someone damaged his cage has become New York City's latest avian celebrity, attracting gawkers as he surveys the park from one tall tree or another but stoking fears that he can't hunt and will starve.The owl, a Eurasian eagle-owl named Flaco, escaped Feb. 2, zoo spokesperson Max Pulsinelli said in a news release the following day. “The exhibit had been vandalized and the stainless steel mesh cut,” Pulsinelli said. “Upon notification, a team was mobilized to search for the bird.”Flaco flew from the zoo to the nearby shopping hub of Fifth Avenue, where police officers tried to catch him and failed.He returned to Central Park the next morning and since then has been spotted at various locations in the southeast section of the park.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804625,"Florida GOP advances Disney district, migrant flight bills","TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Florida lawmakers advanced proposals on Wednesday to strip Disney of its self-governing status, expand a controversial migrant transportation program and strengthen prosecutions tied to the state’s election police unit. 

            The bills, part of a hastily called special legislative session in the GOP-controlled statehouse, are key priorities of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis as he focuses on cultural issues ahead of his expected 2024 White House run. 

            Republicans in a House state affairs committee approved legislation to complete the state takeover of Walt Disney World’s Reedy Creek Improvement District. The measures come as the governor punishes the company over its opposition to a law critics call “Don't Say Gay,” which bars instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through third grade and lessons deemed not age-appropriate. 











            The proposal would leave much of the district intact, including its financial obligations, but would rename it to the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District and require DeSantis to appoint a five-member governing board. Board members previously were named through entities controlled by Disney. 

            “This is obliviously now going to be controlled by the state of Florida, which is no longer self-governing for them,"" DeSantis said at a news conference Wednesday. “So, there’s a new sheriff in town, and that’s just the way its going to be.” 

            Having a separate government allows the Disney district to issue bonds and provide zoning, fire protection, utilities and infrastructure services on its land. Republican opponents of the district argue it gives Disney a commercial advantage unavailable to others. 

            Democratic Rep. Anna Eskamani said the governor would have too much control over the district when he appoints board members and labeled the takeover as a power grab. 

            “I often see this as a low security prison that the company is operating within, where they can pretty much do what they want to do, but if they go off course, they’ll be punished,” she said. “And when you have one official — the governor — appoint board members, it’s not designed to be balanced. It’s designed to pursue what his political motivations and values are.” 

            The Disney district legislation now moves to the full House. 

            Also on Wednesday, Republicans in the full Senate and the House judiciary committee passed separate bills to further DeSantis’ agenda on immigration and voter fraud. 

            One proposal would create the Unauthorized Alien Transport Program in the governor’s administration to relocate migrants within the country if they have been processed by the federal government. 

            The program would further a DeSantis initiative to relocate migrants that began last year when the Republican used taxpayer dollars to fly about 50 South American migrants from Texas to the Massachusetts resort island of Martha’s Vineyard in protest of federal immigration policy. 

            The flight to Martha’s Vineyard, in addition to drawing condemnation, led to legal questions because the governor’s office paid for the trip using money intended to transport migrants who were in Florida, not Texas or any other state. The bill lawmakers are considering specifies that future flights could move migrants from anywhere in the U.S.

            The bill’s Senate sponsor, Republican Sen. Blaise Ingoglia, has said the program would help migrants by taking them to liberal, so-called “sanctuary cities.” 

            “The state of Florida is not, and never will be, a sanctuary state,” he said. “It's time for those sanctuary cities to put their money where their mouth is.” 

            Democrats have heavily criticized the governor's migrant flight program and argued Wednesday that DeSantis was making political pawns out of migrants. 

            “I don't know why we are singling them out, we are making them feel uncomfortable,” said Sen. Lori Berman, a Democrat. “It's basically a political ploy that we are doing here in the state of Florida.” 

            The other proposal would make clear that the statewide prosecutor has authority to prosecute election crimes in federal and state races, legislation meant to strengthen the power of the governor’s new election police unit. 

            DeSantis pushed lawmakers last year to create a law enforcement unit focused on election crimes, addressing a concern of conservative voters after the 2020 election. But in the months since, some of the unit’s charges have been dismissed by judges because of jurisdiction issues. 

            The measures still face additional legislative hearings before they reach final passage, though they are expected to pass the statehouse.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804626,Washington coach Rivera wins NFL's Salute to Service Award,"PHOENIX (AP) — Ron Rivera’s dad served in the United States Army for 32 years. 

            So for the coach of the Washington Commanders, winning the NFL’s Salute to Service Award was extra special.

            The award honors league personnel who take tangible steps to honor and support military communities. USAA — which sponsors the honor — will provide a $25,000 donation to each military branch’s official aid society in Rivera’s name, and the NFL will send a matching donation to a military charity of Rivera’s choice.











            “We traveled the United States, we traveled the world being a military family,” said Rivera during an AP Pro Football Podcast appearance on Wednesday in Phoenix. “Just knowing and seeing the commitment that these men and women make, we most certainly need to give back, and I feel that it is a duty of ours to do that, because I’ve learned so much from being an Army brat.”

            During November’s Salute to Service events, Rivera wore the insignia of his father’s military rank and a patch with his mother’s initials.

            Rivera led the Commanders to an 8-8-1 record over the past season. It was Rivera's third year as Washington's coach after having the same role for nine years with the Carolina Panthers. 

            Tenets of Rivera’s coaching focus — dutiful effort, discipline and accountability — have deep roots stemming from his military childhood.

            “I grew up on Army bases and my education in life was based on that,” Rivera said. “As a family unit, your best friends, your first teammates, are your family members. I tell people, my best two coaches I’ve ever had were mom and dad. My best teammates were my three brothers.”

            Rivera will be recognized Thursday during the NFL Honors prime-time ceremony alongside other league award winners.

            T.J. WATT PRAISES PICKETT, TALKS J.J.'S RETIREMENT

            Steelers quarterback Kenny Pickett had an up-and-down rookie season, throwing two more interceptions than touchdowns.

            But linebacker T.J. Watt said during his appearance on the AP Pro Football Podcast that he’s confident the former Pitt Panthers star will keep growing. 

            Pickett started 12 games during his rookie season, tossing seven touchdowns and nine interceptions, but started to limit his bigger mistakes during the second half of the season. Pickett’s growth stood out to Watt, who saw the young quarterback step up in significant spots.

            “It’s awesome to see in young players, particularly, just the amount of confidence that they grow in themselves and the system and the whole team week to week,” Watt said. “You really saw that with Kenny this year — some big-time drives in big-time games toward the end of the season. I’m just very excited to see how he takes this offseason to improve his game for next year.”

            Watt, who only played in 10 games this season because of a torn pectoral muscle he suffered in Week 1, still earned his fifth Pro Bowl selection. He had 39 tackles, 5 1/2 sacks and two interceptions.

            He now heads into the first offseason of his career after the retirement of his older brother — three-time AP Defensive Player of the Year J.J. Watt. The eldest Watt brother ended his career after 12 years in the NFL, including 10 with the Houston Texans and last two with the Arizona Cardinals.

            “I’m just hoping that he’s not going to be nagging me when I don’t win pass rushes and sending me all these clips trying to be my pass-rush coach,” Watt joked. “I’m not too worried about that. I think he’s going to have a great post-career in whatever he decides to do.”

            GOFF WORKS TO IMPROVE

            Quarterback Jared Golf helped lead the Detroit Lions to nine wins this season, the team’s most wins since 2017. He threw for 4,438 yards, 29 touchdowns and just seven interceptions en route to earning his third Pro Bowl nod.

            Now he hopes the story of his career changes.

            When the Lions traded for Goff in March 2021 — in a deal that sent Matthew Stafford to the Rams — many viewed Goff as a bridge quarterback for the team until it found a young quarterback through the draft.

            “It takes more time to break (narratives) than it does to build them,” Goff said on Tuesday. “It’s just part of our business when you play quarterback, and you’re going to get criticized if things aren’t going well. I was happy to have a good year and have a good year with the guys we did and be able to win some games.”

            Goff’s emergence back to a Pro Bowl-level has come under the tutelage of head coach Dan Campbell. Goff credited Campbell for holding the team accountable while still creating a fun atmosphere and allowing the players to be themselves.

            Microsoft’s Activision deal hurts gamers, UK watchdog says

            LONDON (AP) — Microsoft’s stalled $68.7 billion deal to buy video game company Activision Blizzard has hit a fresh hurdle in the United Kingdom. Britain’s antitrust watchdog said Wednesday that the deal will stifle competition and hurt gamers. The watchdog’s investigation found that the deal could strengthen Microsoft’s position in the growing cloud gaming market. The provisional report also says the deal would weaken the important rivalry between Microsoft’s Xbox console and Sony’s rival PlayStation. The deal faces opposition from Sony and pushback from regulators worldwide because it would give Microsoft control of popular game franchises like Call of Duty, World of Warcraft and Candy Crush. Microsoft says it’s “committed to offering effective and easily enforceable solutions.”

            Primary care a hot target; CVS spends $10.6B on Oak Street

            Big money is pouring into primary care clinics as the nation’s health care giants hunt for ways to cut costs by keeping people healthy. CVS Health said Wednesday that it will spend about $10.6 billion to buy Oak Street Health, which runs clinics that specialize in treating Medicare Advantage patients. That follows a nearly $9-billion investment by rival Walgreens in VillageMD’s acquisition of the urgent and primary care chain Summit Health-CityMD. Both deals involve an expansion of value-based care, an approach to medicine growing popular with bill payers like the federal government’s Medicare program.

            Oil major TotalEnergies doubles annual profit to $36 billion

            PARIS (AP) — France’s TotalEnergies SE doubled its profits in 2022, joining other international oil and gas companies in fattening their bottom lines as high energy prices surged after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The company said Wednesday that adjusted net income rose to $36.2 billion, up from $18.1 billion in 2021. Big oil company profits have led to calls to tax more of the gains that were boosted by a surge in oil and natural prices after Western companies shunned or were largely cut off from Russian supplies. TotalEnergies says it had paid $33 billion in taxes during 2022, most of it to countries where it produces oil and natural gas.

            Disney to cut 7,000 jobs in Iger’s company ‘transformation’

            LOS ANGELES (AP) — The Walt Disney Co. says it will cut about 7,000 jobs as part of a “significant transformation” announced by CEO Bob Iger. The job cuts amount to about 3% of the entertainment’s global workforce and were announced Wednesday after Disney reported quarterly results that topped Wall Street’s forecasts. Iger returned as CEO in November following a challenging two-year tenure by his handpicked successor, Bob Chapek. The company says the job reductions are part of a targeted $5.5 billion cost savings across the company. In its latest results, solid growth at Disney’s theme parks helped offset tepid performance in its video streaming and movie business.

            Netflix steps up its effort to get paid for account sharing

            Netflix has a plan to deal with rampant account sharing: a program that lets subscribers pay extra to share their account with people outside their household. The streaming giant introduced paid sharing in Canada, New Zealand, Portugal and Spain on Wednesday. It was previously rolled out in Latin America, and some version of the plan is expected to be introduced in the U.S. in the next few weeks. Netflix estimates that 100 million households are currently sharing their accounts with people outside their household. The company says that hurts its ability to invest in new programming.

            NEW YORK (AP) — Big name advertisers from Netflix to Google are paying as much as $7 million for a 30-second spot during the Super Bowl on Sunday. In order to get as much as a return on investment for those millions, most advertisers release their ads in the days ahead of the big game to get the most publicity for their spots. In the ads released early, actor Miles Teller dances to customer-service hold music for Bud Light, Will Ferrell crashes popular Netflix shows like “Bridgerton” in a joint ad for GM and Netflix; and Alicia Silverstone reprises her “Clueless” character for online retailer Rakuten.

            Biden warns of GOP plans for Medicare, Social Security cuts

            WASHINGTON (AP) — When President Joe Biden suggested that Republicans want to slash Medicare and Social Security it brought howls of protests from the GOP side of the aisle during the State of the Union address. But it also showcased a stunning turnaround for the Republican Party that built a brand on doing just that. There was President George W. Bush’s idea about privatizing Social Security, House Speaker Paul Ryan’s sweepy Medicare overhaul and current Republican Sen. Rick Scott’s idea of “sunsetting” major entitlement programs. As the president and the Congress launch budget negotiations ahead of the debt ceiling deadline, Biden is not going to let Republicans forget that history.

Britain’s antitrust watchdog said Wednesday that the deal will stifle competition and hurt gamers. The watchdog’s investigation found that the deal could strengthen Microsoft’s position in the growing cloud gaming market. The provisional report also says the deal would weaken the important rivalry between Microsoft’s Xbox console and Sony’s rival PlayStation. The deal faces opposition from Sony and pushback from regulators worldwide because it would give Microsoft control of popular game franchises like Call of Duty, World of Warcraft and Candy Crush. Microsoft says it’s “committed to offering effective and easily enforceable solutions.”___Primary care a hot target; CVS spends $10.6B on Oak StreetBig money is pouring into primary care clinics as the nation’s health care giants hunt for ways to cut costs by keeping people healthy.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804632,"Turkey leader acknowledges earthquake relief problems as death toll passes 12,000","KAHRAMANMARAS/ANTAKYA, Turkey, Feb 8 (Reuters) - President Tayyip Erdogan on Wednesday admitted there were problems with his government's initial response to a devastating earthquake in southern Turkey, amid anger from those left destitute and frustrated over the slow arrival of rescue teams.Erdogan, who contests an election in May, said on a visit to the disaster zone that operations were now working normally and promised no one would be left homeless, as the combined reported death toll across Turkey and neighbouring Syria rose past 12,000.Across a swathe of southern Turkey, people sought temporary shelter and food in freezing winter weather, and waited in anguish by piles of rubble where family and friends might still lie buried.Rescuers were still finding some people alive. But many Turks have complained of a lack of equipment, expertise and support to rescue those trapped - sometimes even as they could hear cries for help.""Where is the state? Where have they been for two days? We are begging them. Let us do it, we can get them out,"" Sabiha Alinak said near a snow-covered collapsed building in the city of Malatya where her young relatives were trapped.There were similar scenes and complaints in neighbouring Syria, whose north was hard hit by Monday's huge quake.Syria's ambassador to the United Nations admitted the government had a ""lack of capabilities and lack of equipment,"" blaming more than a decade of civil war in his country and Western sanctions.DEATH TOLL SURE TO RISEThe death toll from both countries was expected to rise as hundreds of collapsed buildings in many cities have become tombs for people who had been asleep when the quake hit.In the Turkish city of Antakya, dozens of bodies, some covered in blankets and sheets and others in body bags, were lined up on the ground outside a hospital.Melek, 64, bemoaned the lack of rescue teams. ""We survived the earthquake, but we will die here due to hunger or cold.""Many in the disaster zone had slept in their cars or in the streets under blankets in freezing cold, fearful of going back into buildings shaken by the 7.8 magnitude tremor - Turkey's deadliest since 1999 - and by a second powerful quake hours later.The confirmed death toll rose to 9,057 in Turkey on Wednesday, and in Syria had climbed to at least 2,950, according to the government and a rescue service operating in the rebel-held northwest.Turkish authorities released video of rescued survivors, including a young girl in pyjamas, and an older man covered in dust, an unlit cigarette between his fingers as he was pulled from the debris.Turkish officials say some 13.5 million people were affected in an area spanning roughly 450 km (280 miles) from Adana in the west to Diyarbakir in the east. In Syria, people were killed as far south as Hama, 250 km from the epicentre.Some who died in Turkey were refugees from Syria's war. Their body bags arrived at the border in taxis, vans and piled atop flatbed trucks to be taken to final resting places in their homeland.More than 298,000 people have been made homeless and 180 shelters for the displaced had been opened, Syrian state media reported, apparently referring to areas under government control, and not held by opposition factions.In Syria, relief efforts are complicated by a conflict that has partitioned the nation and wrecked its infrastructure.The delivery of U.N. humanitarian aid via Turkey to millions of people in northwest Syria could resume on Thursday after the long-running operation was halted by the quake, U.N. officials said.In the Syrian city of Aleppo, staff at the Al-Razi hospital attended to an injured man who said more than a dozen relatives including his mother and father were killed when the building they were in collapsed.ELECTION IMPACTErdogan, who declared a state of emergency in 10 provinces and sent troops to help, arrived in Kahramanmaras to view the damage and see the rescue and relief effort.Speaking to reporters, a wail of ambulance sirens in the background, he said there had been problems with roads and airports but ""we are better today"".""We will be better tomorrow and later. We still have some issues with fuel ... but we will overcome those too,"" Erdogan said.He later condemned criticism of the government's response. ""This is a time for unity, solidarity. In a period like this, I cannot stomach people conducting negative campaigns for political interest,"" Erdogan told reporters in the southern province of Hatay.Nevertheless, the disaster will pose a challenge to Erdogan in the May election that was already set to be the toughest fight of his two decades in power. Istanbul's stock exchange operator suspended trading for five days in an unprecedented step.Any perception that the government is failing to address the disaster properly could hurt his prospects. Conversely, analysts say he could rally national support around the crisis response and strengthen his position.Syrian President Bashar al-Assad appears to be seeking political advantage from the quake, pressing for foreign aid to be delivered through his territory as he aims to chip away at his international isolation, analysts said.Twitter was restricted in Turkey on Wednesday, the Netblocks internet observatory said.The move ""comes as the public come to rely on the service in the aftermath of a series of deadly earthquakes,"" said Netblocks, which tracks connectivity across the globe.Cyber rights expert and professor at Istanbul Bilgi University Yaman Akdeniz said it was not clear what caused the restriction, adding that access to Tiktok was also limited in Turkey.""How come Twitter is restricted on a day communication saves lives?,"" the head of the DEVA opposition party, Ali Babacan, said on Twitter.The Transportation and Infrastructure Ministry, which could impose such restrictions, was not available for comment.",2023/2/9,314,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804633,Driver in strange Tesla crash apparently moved to rear seat,"DETROIT (AP) — Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board apparently have solved the mystery of why no one was found behind the steering wheel of a Tesla that crashed in a Texas two years ago, killing two men.

            The agency said in an investigative report released Wednesday on the fiery April 17, 2021 crash in the Houston suburb of Spring that the 59-year-old Tesla driver apparently moved to the back seat after slamming into the car's front air bag, deforming the steering wheel in the crash. 

            Although the crash raised questions about whether the car was operating on Tesla's “Autopilot” partially automated driving system, the NTSB determined that the system could not have been used on the street where the crash happened due to lack of lane lines. Testing showed the car's “Traffic Aware Cruise Control” system could have been used, although it would only work up to the maximum speed on the suburban road, 30 mph (50 kilometers per hour), the report said.











            The 2019 Tesla reached 67 mph (108 kilometers per hour) two seconds before hitting the second of two trees at 57 mph (92 kilometers per hour) before being consumed by flames as the lithium-ion battery caught fire.

            The Tesla's event data recorder showed that the accelerator moved “consistent with driver activity” in the five seconds before the crash, and that the driver's seat belt was connected when the crash happened.

            “Although the driver’s seat was found vacant and the driver was found in the left rear seat, the available evidence suggests that the driver was seated in the driver’s seat at the time of the crash and moved into the rear seat postcrash,” the report said.

            The agency found that excessive speed and failure to control the car due to alcohol impairment caused the crash. The report says testing by a Federal Aviation Administration lab found that the driver had a blood-alcohol level of 0.151 grams per deciliter, almost twice the Texas legal limit of 0.08. Two over-the-counter sedating antihistamine medications also were found in the driver's blood, according to the report.

            Autopsies determined that the driver died from blunt force trauma, burns and smoke inhalation. The 69-year-old male passenger died from blunt force trauma to the torso and extremities, as well as burns, the report said.

            The agency said security video from the driver's home showed the driver and passenger getting into the front seats before driving away from the home. The car traveled about 550 feet (170 meters) before leaving the road on a curve, hitting a storm sewer inlet and raised manhole, sideswiping one tree before hitting another, the agency said.DETROIT (AP) — Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board apparently have solved the mystery of why no one was found behind the steering wheel of a Tesla that crashed in a Texas two years ago, killing two men.The agency said in an investigative report released Wednesday on the fiery April 17, 2021 crash in the Houston suburb of Spring that the 59-year-old Tesla driver apparently moved to the back seat after slamming into the car's front air bag, deforming the steering wheel in the crash.Although the crash raised questions about whether the car was operating on Tesla's “Autopilot” partially automated driving system, the NTSB determined that the system could not have been used on the street where the crash happened due to lack of lane lines.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804634,Lawmaker: Power struggle is 'decapitation' of Black-run city,"JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Black lawmakers in Mississippi are denouncing efforts by the majority-white and Republican-led state Legislature to grab power from the majority-Black and Democratic-led capital city of Jackson.

            “The actions being taken by our legislative leadership amount to a symbolic decapitation of Black elected leadership,” Democratic Sen. John Horhn of Jackson said Wednesday during a Legislative Black Caucus news conference.

            The state Senate voted Tuesday to create a regional board to eventually take control of Jackson's struggling water system, which is now overseen by a federally appointed administrator.











            Hours later, the House voted to create a new court in part of Jackson with judges who would be appointed rather than elected.

            The two bills are not yet close to becoming law. The Senate bill will go to the House for more work, and the House bill will go to the Senate. 

            Nearly 83% of Jackson residents are Black, and the city has had Black mayors since 1997.

            Bills to create the regional water board and the new court system are sponsored by white, Republican lawmakers who live in northern Mississippi, more than two hours’ drive from Jackson. In both cases, the sponsors said they wrote the bills without first consulting Jackson lawmakers. The Senate sponsor said he later incorporated ideas from Jackson officials.

            One bill would create a Capitol Complex Improvement District court in the more affluent — and whiter — parts of Jackson. Judges would be appointed by the chief justice of the Mississippi Supreme Court, and prosecutors would be appointed by the state attorney general, both of whom are white.

            Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba has likened the court proposal to apartheid. During a nearly five-hour debate on the court bill, several Black lawmakers said the proposal would strip away voting rights in a state with a racist history of voter suppression. 

            Democratic Rep. Zakiya Summers of Jackson said at the news conference Wednesday that the proposal would create a “separate but unequal court.""

            “This is a return to the old Mississippi –- to slave patrols, to convict leasing, to installing ‘the folks we like because we never wanted y’all to vote in the first place,'"" Summers said. ""It’s a return to a shameful past that kept us pushed out, kicked out and silenced.”

            Black legislators said establishing a regional water board is a paternalistic move to wrest power from Jackson's mayor and City Council. 

            Jackson has struggled with water problems for years. The crisis culminated in late August and early September, when the system came near collapse and most people in the city of 150,000 went several days without running water. Some lost water again after a cold snap in December.

            The city is receiving $600 million from the federal government to improve the water system. Lumumba has said repeatedly that the city must maintain long-term control of the water system after the appointed administrator departs.

            Democratic Rep. Chris Bell of Jackson said Wednesday that the efforts of the majority of legislators to control the capital city show “the devaluation of Black assets, the devaluation of Black lives, the devaluation of Black well-being in the city of Jackson.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804635,Win in court doesn't assure more Pennsylvania school funding,"HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Pennsylvania is the latest state where the public school funding system was found to be unconstitutional, but the experience in other states suggests there's no guarantee of swift, significant or longstanding change for the poorer school districts that sued in hopes of getting billions of dollars more for their budgets.

            Tuesday's ruling after nearly a decade in the courts was hailed by supporters as a “historic” judgment on what they call a broken and discriminatory system that has long favored the wealthy.

            An appeal is possible within 30 days. 











            If the decision survives, it should have at least some impact on school budgets, since lawmakers elsewhere have generally responded with additional funding when confronted by a judge, according to scholars who have studied similar litigation in dozens of states.

            In nearly every one of those cases, however, lawmakers did not approve enough extra funding to be fully compliant with judges' orders, said Joshua Weishart, a West Virginia University law professor who specializes in education rights.

            Lawmakers can be recalcitrant, forcing cases to drag on for years or decades. Some plaintiffs have returned to court multiple times, sometimes in vain, to seek help in forcing legislatures to act, scholars say.

            The cases can also be complicated by economic, political and other factors, and courts can tire of trying to force compliance.

            For instance a recession could drain a state’s treasury and, with it, the political will to follow through on a judge’s order. Elections can install new lawmakers, governors or judges who are hostile to funding changes. Sometimes lawmakers make strides, but then backslide, scholars say.

            So the Pennsylvania judge's “nudge” to legislators is only one piece in a larger puzzle that is necessary to solve such a big problem, said Bruce Baker, a University of Miami education professor who researches public school financing.

            “The judicial nudge I think matters, but it matters more when the other pieces are in place to enable reform to be implemented and sustained,"" Baker said.

            It also matters how big the problem is, Baker said.

            In Pennsylvania — which Baker has found to be the most inequitable state for school funding, along with Illinois — the cost of addressing funding disparities will be high compared with other states because it means dealing with huge gaps involving big school districts like Philadelphia, Allentown and Reading, Baker said.

            The plaintiffs in the lawsuit, which included six school districts, the NAACP and the Pennsylvania Association of Rural and Small Schools, presented evidence at trial that state schools are underfunded by $4.6 billion, an estimate they said does not account for spending on special education and school buildings.

            They also urged the state’s divided Legislature and newly elected Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro to act quickly.

            However, Commonwealth Court Judge Renee Cohn Jubelirer did not direct the Legislature on how much aid to distribute, or how, or give a deadline.

            As state attorney general last year, Shapiro filed a brief supporting the lawsuit’s aims and pledged on the campaign trail to “fully fund” schools.

            He must present his first budget plan to lawmakers in less than four weeks, and plaintiffs' lawyers hope it will include a significant sum for poorer public schools as a step towards complying with the court’s order. Shapiro has given little indication as to how he will respond, however. 

            Top Republican lawmakers, who opposed the lawsuit, have not said whether they will appeal, but have shown no willingness thus far to follow the ruling. The House Republican floor leader, Rep. Bryan Cutler of Lancaster County, accused the court on Wednesday of overstepping its bounds.

            Plaintiffs' lawyers said they will work with Shapiro and legislators to develop a plan that the court will approve. But they also acknowledged that it is up to lawmakers to act.

            “If they don't, frankly it’s hard to predict how long it will take,” said Michael Churchill of the nonprofit Public Interest Law Center, which helped represent the plaintiffs. ""All we can say is we will act to get an expeditious remedy as fast as we can.”

Sometimes lawmakers make strides, but then backslide, scholars say.So the Pennsylvania judge's “nudge” to legislators is only one piece in a larger puzzle that is necessary to solve such a big problem, said Bruce Baker, a University of Miami education professor who researches public school financing.“The judicial nudge I think matters, but it matters more when the other pieces are in place to enable reform to be implemented and sustained,"" Baker said.It also matters how big the problem is, Baker said.In Pennsylvania — which Baker has found to be the most inequitable state for school funding, along with Illinois — the cost of addressing funding disparities will be high compared with other states because it means dealing with huge gaps involving big school districts like Philadelphia, Allentown and Reading, Baker said.The plaintiffs in the lawsuit, which included six school districts, the NAACP and the Pennsylvania Association of Rural and Small Schools, presented evidence at trial that state schools are underfunded by $4.6 billion, an estimate they said does not account for spending on special education and school buildings.They also urged the state’s divided Legislature and newly elected Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro to act quickly.However, Commonwealth Court Judge Renee Cohn Jubelirer did not direct the Legislature on how much aid to distribute, or how, or give a deadline.As state attorney general last year, Shapiro filed a brief supporting the lawsuit’s aims and pledged on the campaign trail to “fully fund” schools.He must present his first budget plan to lawmakers in less than four weeks, and plaintiffs' lawyers hope it will include a significant sum for poorer public schools as a step towards complying with the court’s order. Shapiro has given little indication as to how he will respond, however.Top Republican lawmakers, who opposed the lawsuit, have not said whether they will appeal, but have shown no willingness thus far to follow the ruling. The House Republican floor leader, Rep. Bryan Cutler of Lancaster County, accused the court on Wednesday of overstepping its bounds.Plaintiffs' lawyers said they will work with Shapiro and legislators to develop a plan that the court will approve. But they also acknowledged that it is up to lawmakers to act.“If they don't, frankly it’s hard to predict how long it will take,” said Michael Churchill of the nonprofit Public Interest Law Center, which helped represent the plaintiffs. ""All we can say is we will act to get an expeditious remedy as fast as we can.”___Follow Marc Levy on Twitter: http://twitter.com/timelywriter",2023/2/9,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804636,California bill would protect native western Joshua tree,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — The western Joshua tree won't be listed as threatened — yet — as California’s Fish and Game Commission again delayed a decision Wednesday after a bill was proposed to provide protections to the native desert plant.

            The proposed legislation, the Western Joshua Tree Conservation Act, was made public late Tuesday. Backed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom's administration, it would prohibit anyone from importing, exporting or removing the tree without a permit from the state. It would also require the state to work with Native American tribes to draft a conservation plan for the tree by 2024.

            “The western Joshua tree is iconic,” California Department of Fish and Wildlife Director Chuck Bonham said Wednesday. “It deserves special consideration through its own law.”











            Bonham said the legislation would mandate protections for the tree while also simplifying the permit process for getting permission to remove it.

            The bill states that “there is a critical need to immediately conserve the species while also ensuring timely and efficient permitting mechanisms for activities within its range.”

            The proposal comes after the Fish and Game Commission, an agency that sets regulations for the Department of Fish and Wildlife to implement, has spent months deliberating on whether to list the tree as threatened under the California Endangered Species Act after advancing a petition on the issue in 2020. 

            The Center for Biological Diversity, which filed the petition in 2019, says it needs to be protected from threats driven by climate change. While the center is pleased Newsom’s administration is taking up this issue with the proposed legislation, Brendan Cummings, the group's conservation director, still wants to see the tree listed as threatened.

            Cummings said the western Joshua tree is different from species already listed as threatened under the California Endangered Species Act because it still exists in large numbers. Despite this, he said “there's a whole body of peer-reviewed published science” that show the threats climate change poses to the species.

            “We just need to ensure that we’re protecting the right places long term and doing, probably, active management to help the species get through the very difficult decades ahead,” Cummings said.

            The California Endangered Species Act, a decades-old law aimed at conserving plants and animals at risk of extinction, protects about 250 species listed as threatened. Species under consideration to be listed also receive protections.

            The Fish and Game Commission voted unanimously Wednesday to postpone its decision, allowing for the tree to remain protected in the meantime, so it cannot be removed without permission from the Department of Fish and Wildlife.

            “I see something that has the potential to really be CESA equivalent but that is less burdensome in the correct areas,” Commissioner Samantha Murray said, referring to the Endangered Species Act.

            In June, some opposed to listing the tree as threatened made public comments about the impact the move could have on housing and solar projects in the region. In October, the commission voted to push back its decision to give more time for tribes to weigh in on the issue.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804637,US forward Alex Morgan supports transgender kids in sports,"Forward Alex Morgan says the U.S. national team should have internal discussions about playing games in states that restrict transgender kids from participating in sports. 

            The team is currently preparing for the SheBelieves Cup, a round-robin tournament with Canada, Brazil and Japan that starts next week. Matches are scheduled in Florida and Texas, two states that have enacted laws aimed at transgender athletes. 

            “Looking at these games in Florida and Texas respectively, we’re going to need to continue to step it up, and have internal discussions as well with the team, because we’re not ones to shy away from hard conversation or taking a stand for what’s right,” Morgan said Wednesday during a conference call with reporters. 











            The U.S. women have previously criticized efforts to limit transgender kids from playing organized sports. Last year during a game in Texas, several players wore wristbands that said “Protect Trans Kids.”

            The team has often used its platform to call attention to social justice, most notably the successful fight for equal pay with the men's team. More recently, players have been vocal about reproductive rights. 

            Defender Becky Sauerbrunn wrote an op-ed last week for the Springfield News-Leader in her home state of Missouri defending the rights of transgender athletes. State lawmakers there are considering legislation to restrict transgender girls from taking part in girls sports. 

            “Playing in Florida and Texas, that’s something that the team definitely needs to look at,"" Morgan said, ""I think just even talking about it is good.”

            “The inclusion of trans kids in sports is the inclusion of kids in sports. Everyone should have the ability to play sport. And the fact that it’s being taken into politics so big is really sad. And I think it’s at the cost of trans kids’ lives,"" Morgan said. ""It’s really sad, and I feel like what Becky said was great. And for this team, we’ve always been very vocal with where we stand and I think we’ll continue to do that. ”

            Sauerbrunn wrote that if lawmakers truly cared about women's sports, they would be looking at sexual abuse and harassment of players in the game, as well as equal opportunities and resources for women and girls in sport, particularly in marginalized communities. 

            “The Missouri I know, love and grew up in is where I was taught to care for my neighbors, and where I learned that the best part of sports is belonging to a team and working together toward a common goal,"" Sauerbrunn wrote. ""I can’t stay quiet as transgender youth in my home state are targeted simply because they love sports as much as I do. I want every young person to have the same opportunities I’ve had to live their best life, exactly as they are.”

            Morgan was also asked about the possible sponsorship deal between FIFA and Saudi Arabia's tourism authority for the upcoming Women's World Cup in Australia and New Zealand this summer. 

            Both the Australian and New Zealand soccer federations have decried the move because of Saudi Arabia's human rights record, especially when it comes to women and LGBTQ individuals. Women's rights in Saudi Arabia are restricted under strict male guardianship laws and homosexuality is illegal. 

            “I think it’s bizarre that FIFA has looked to have a `Visit Saudi’ sponsorship for the Women’s World Cup when I, myself, Alex Morgan, would not even be supported and accepted in that country, so I just don’t understand it,"" she said. “I think that what Saudi Arabia can do is put efforts into their women’s team that was just formed only a couple of years ago and doesn’t even have a current ranking within the FIFA ranking system because of the few games that they’ve played. 

            ""So that would be my advice to them. And I really hope that FIFA does the right thing.”

            FIFA has not commented on the possible sponsorship deal.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804656,"Rashford, Sancho answer taunts with goals to get Man U point","MANCHESTER, England (AP) — In the face of cruel taunts from Leeds fans, Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho responded in style. 

            Both players scored in a rousing second-half comeback as Manchester United rallied Wednesday to salvage a 2-2 draw in the Premier League. 

            “You let your country down,” fans chanted in the away section at Old Trafford, bringing back painful memories of the United forwards' penalty misses in England's Euro 2020 final shootout defeat to Italy. 











            But by the end of the game Rashford had scored his 20th goal of the season in all competitions to start United's comeback and Sancho had equalized to mark his return to the team. 

            Sancho's contribution was significant after he was given time off earlier this season in a bid to reignite his career. 

            “I am really happy he is in the right direction, I hope he can keep his momentum going and I am sure it will strengthen him and motivate him even more,” United manager Erik ten Hag said. “He is a brilliant footballer and if he can invest in the right levels he can be outstanding.”

            Both Rashford and Sancho have taken time to get back on track after the disappointment of the Euros, which saw them subjected to racist abuse, along with Arsenal's Bukayo Saka, who also missed a penalty. 

            Rashford, however, is producing possibly the finest form of his career this season, while Saka is a key part of Arsenal's title challenge. 

            It has not been the same story for Sancho, who has struggled for consistency since joining United from Borussia Dortmund in 2021. 

            He lost his England place and missed out on last year's World Cup. And as his United form continued to suffer, he was given a break by Ten Hag before going on as a substitute against Nottingham Forest last week to make his first appearance since October. 

            With United facing a shock loss to relegation-fighting Leeds after going 2-0 down early in the second half, Sancho was given his chance to make an impact and didn't disappoint with a clinical finish to salvage a draw. 

            “I wanted a different dynamic. In that moment we weren’t in the game. Luckily it succeeded because we scored two goals,"" Ten Hag said. “He’s all the way back. We know he’s a magnificent player. I think consistently he can have a big impact.”

            As rousing as United's comeback was, it couldn't shake the sense that its title ambitions had been dealt a blow. 

            Leeds, without a manager following the firing of Jesse Marsch on Monday and struggling for survival in the top flight, went close to consigning United to a first home defeat in the league since the opening day of the season after Wilfried Gnonto struck just 55 seconds into the match and Raphael Varane put the ball into his own net early in the second half. 

            Rashford and Sancho rescued a point, but United remains seven off leader Arsenal, having played two games more.

            “Mixed feelings. Of course in the end we were happy to win a point — but we dropped two points,"" Ten Hag said. ""It’s a very bad start, unacceptable, especially in a derby you have to be ready to battle and take responsibility. We didn’t do that.”

            FULHAM ADVANCES

            Fulham booked its place in the fifth round of the FA Cup with a 3-2 win in its replay with Sunderland.

            More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsMANCHESTER, England (AP) — In the face of cruel taunts from Leeds fans, Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho responded in style.Both players scored in a rousing second-half comeback as Manchester United rallied Wednesday to salvage a 2-2 draw in the Premier League.“You let your country down,” fans chanted in the away section at Old Trafford, bringing back painful memories of the United forwards' penalty misses in England's Euro 2020 final shootout defeat to Italy.But by the end of the game Rashford had scored his 20th goal of the season in all competitions to start United's comeback and Sancho had equalized to mark his return to the team.Sancho's contribution was significant after he was given time off earlier this season in a bid to reignite his career.“I am really happy he is in the right direction, I hope he can keep his momentum going and I am sure it will strengthen him and motivate him even more,” United manager Erik ten Hag said. “He is a brilliant footballer and if he can invest in the right levels he can be outstanding.”Both Rashford and Sancho have taken time to get back on track after the disappointment of the Euros, which saw them subjected to racist abuse, along with Arsenal's Bukayo Saka, who also missed a penalty.Rashford, however, is producing possibly the finest form of his career this season, while Saka is a key part of Arsenal's title challenge.It has not been the same story for Sancho, who has struggled for consistency since joining United from Borussia Dortmund in 2021.He lost his England place and missed out on last year's World Cup. And as his United form continued to suffer, he was given a break by Ten Hag before going on as a substitute against Nottingham Forest last week to make his first appearance since October.With United facing a shock loss to relegation-fighting Leeds after going 2-0 down early in the second half, Sancho was given his chance to make an impact and didn't disappoint with a clinical finish to salvage a draw.“I wanted a different dynamic. In that moment we weren’t in the game. Luckily it succeeded because we scored two goals,"" Ten Hag said. “He’s all the way back. We know he’s a magnificent player. I think consistently he can have a big impact.”As rousing as United's comeback was, it couldn't shake the sense that its title ambitions had been dealt a blow.Leeds, without a manager following the firing of Jesse Marsch on Monday and struggling for survival in the top flight, went close to consigning United to a first home defeat in the league since the opening day of the season after Wilfried Gnonto struck just 55 seconds into the match and Raphael Varane put the ball into his own net early in the second half.Rashford and Sancho rescued a point, but United remains seven off leader Arsenal, having played two games more.“Mixed feelings. Of course in the end we were happy to win a point — but we dropped two points,"" Ten Hag said. ""It’s a very bad start, unacceptable, especially in a derby you have to be ready to battle and take responsibility. We didn’t do that.”FULHAM ADVANCESFulham booked its place in the fifth round of the FA Cup with a 3-2 win in its replay with Sunderland.Harry Wilson and Andreas Pereira put the Premier League club in control, but Jack Clarke pulled one back for the home team.Layvin Kurzawa made it 3-1 before Jewison Bennette struck for second-tier Sunderland.Fulham faces Leeds in the next round.___James Robson is at https://twitter.com/jamesalanrobson___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/2/9,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804657,Pope seeks release of Cubans arrests during 2021 protests,"HAVANA (AP) — Pope Francis hopes Cuban authorities will release and grant amnesty to people arrested and sentenced after the historic protests that took place in 2021, Cardinal Beniamino Stella, who traveled to the island as the pontiff’s special envoy, said Wednesday.

            During an act at the University of Havana to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Pope John Paul II's visit to the island, Cardinal Stella also said the Catholic Church hopes that Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel and U.S. President Joe Biden can hold talks amid current tense relations between the countries.

            Stella, who arrived in Cuba in mid-January and will remain there until Feb. 10, recalled the figures of Father Félix Varela and José Martí, considered national heroes in Cuba, and emphasized the need for understanding among Cubans.











            Asked by journalists about the possibility the Catholic Church could intercede to have Cuban authorities grant amnesty to people imprisoned during the 2021 protests, the first in decades on the island, Stella said he had talked with the pontiff about the issue before he trip to Cuba. 

            “The Church wants, seeks, has manifested this proposal (amnesty),” said Stella. “I think the issue is on the table... The Pope very much wants there to be a positive response, whether it is called amnesty, clemency, the words can be secondary, but it is important that the young people who at one point expressed their thoughts... they can go back to their homes.”

            According to non-governmental groups, about 1,300 people were arrested following the protests. Some of the demonstrations turned violent, including looting and rioting, and one person was killed. Authorities reported about 700 sentences handed down related to the protests, with sentences ranging from a fine and community work to up to 30 years in prison for sedition.

            The protests took place amid a severe economic crisis, shortages and blackouts. Human rights groups and some governments, including Washington, harshly criticized the island for what they considered the repression of free demonstrations by Cubans. 

            Meanwhile, Havana maintains that it did not repress opponents, but only punished illegal activities like rioting, vandalism, and sedition.

            The Catholic Church has political influence in Cuba and on previous occasions has interceded successfully for the liberation of government opponents. 

            In 2010, thanks to the mediation of the Catholic Church and Spain’s government, a group of opponents who had been imprisoned since 2003 were released and some chose to leave the country.

            The Cuban government accused anti-Castro groups based in Florida of promoting riots during the 2021 protests through social networks amid a complex economic situation caused by the paralysis during the pandemic and the increase in U.S. sanctions during the administration of then-President Donald Trump.HAVANA (AP) — Pope Francis hopes Cuban authorities will release and grant amnesty to people arrested and sentenced after the historic protests that took place in 2021, Cardinal Beniamino Stella, who traveled to the island as the pontiff’s special envoy, said Wednesday.During an act at the University of Havana to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Pope John Paul II's visit to the island, Cardinal Stella also said the Catholic Church hopes that Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel and U.S. President Joe Biden can hold talks amid current tense relations between the countries.Stella, who arrived in Cuba in mid-January and will remain there until Feb. 10, recalled the figures of Father Félix Varela and José Martí, considered national heroes in Cuba, and emphasized the need for understanding among Cubans.Asked by journalists about the possibility the Catholic Church could intercede to have Cuban authorities grant amnesty to people imprisoned during the 2021 protests, the first in decades on the island, Stella said he had talked with the pontiff about the issue before he trip to Cuba.“The Church wants, seeks, has manifested this proposal (amnesty),” said Stella. “I think the issue is on the table...

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804667,Eagles count on pass rush to harass Mahomes in Super Bowl,"PHOENIX (AP) — The defensive philosophy that has carried the Philadelphia Eagles to the Super Bowl is relatively simple.

            A deep rotation of defensive linemen provides constant pressure that makes opposing quarterbacks uncomfortable and often leads to them ending on the ground. 

            “It’s always a race to the quarterback,” defensive tackle Fletcher Cox said. “We all look at it every week that we have to earn the right to rush the quarterback and guys buy into that.""











            Few teams have gotten to the quarterback more frequently this season than the Eagles, who are closing in on the NFL’s most prolific season ever when it comes to sacks.

            That will be the formula the Eagles (16-3) will hope to replicate on Sunday against Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs (16-3).

            “Any time you play these great quarterbacks, you got to affect them because you can’t have them out here playing 7 on 7,” defensive end Brandon Graham said. “The line definitely has to affect anything that goes on with the play. I know that we’ve got a great D-line, but we got to prove it each and every week. I’m excited because we do got a task we got to achieve going against Mahomes.”

            That won't be easy even with Mahomes on a gimpy ankle. He was the best quarterback in the league this season at avoiding sacks, with only 10.2% of pressures turning into sacks, according to Pro Football Focus.

            Mahomes was sacked three times in his previous Super Bowl appearance two years ago against Tampa Bay when he was constantly on the run behind a banged-up line.

            Kansas City has bolstered the line since then, but Mahomes knows it will be difficult against the Eagles. 

            “They’re on like a historic sack rate and the way they’re able to get to the quarterback,” Mahomes said. ""So everybody knows that everything starts up front. It’ll be a great challenge for our offensive line to try to do what they can.”

            Philadelphia followed up a regular season with 70 sacks — tied for the third-most ever — with eight more so far in the playoffs. The 78 sacks combined in the regular season and playoffs have been topped only by the Chicago’s Monsters of the Midway with 82 sacks in 1984 and 80 the next season.

            While the Eagles benefitted from a 17th regular-season game, their rate of sacks is also quite impressive. They have sacked the quarterback on 11.5% of drop-backs this season for the highest rate in a season since 1989, when the Vikings did it on 12.2% of drop-backs.

            “Being a part of a pass rush where everybody gets the chance to eat, that’s the best thing,” star defensive end Haason Reddick said. “It causes no problems. Everybody gets their chance. Everybody gets the chance to get their stats up. Everybody gets their chance to make an impact at the end of the day. When you have a D-line like we have, it’s crazy. All it takes is for one person to make a play and then the energy amongst everybody is just rolling.”

            Philadelphia spreads the wealth around with a record four players reaching double digits in the regular season: Reddick (16), Javon Hargrave (11), Josh Sweat (11) and Graham (11).

            But Reddick is the one who sets the tone. He had 1 1/2 sacks on the opening drive of a divisional round win against the Giants and then the strip-sack that injured San Francisco quarterback Brock Purdy's elbow on the first drive in the NFC championship game.

            It's been part of a fairytale season for Reddick that will end where he started his NFL career. A first-round pick by Arizona in 2017, Reddick struggled early in his career with just 7 1/2 sacks his first three seasons while often playing out of position as an off-ball linebacker.

            Reddick has put together three straight double-digit sack seasons in his final year with the Cardinals, one year in Carolina and this season in Philadelphia, where he has relished the opportunity to be back near his boyhood home in New Jersey playing for the team he rooted for as a kid.

            “For me, it is a dream,” Reddick said. “I’m getting to live it each and every day, which is a blessing in itself. But looking back at that, if you would have told me that this would happen back then and I looked at you and said, I hope so.” 

            Now Reddick is looking for one final accomplishment to add to this memorable season: sacking Mahomes in a Super Bowl win.

            “He’s one of the quarterbacks in the league that I haven’t been able to sack or haven’t gotten to yet” he said. “So if I’m able to get to him and I get him in a Super Bowl, that’s going to be historic for me.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804668,Falcons' Blank excited about building around Ridder at QB,"Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank said Wednesday he is encouraged by the progress of quarterback Desmond Ridder and the potential of building around the rookie.

            Blank, speaking with Falcons reporters via phone from the Super Bowl, expressed confidence in the direction of the team following a 7-10 finish under second-year coach Arthur Smith. As others have speculated the Falcons could have interest in a high-priced quarterback like Lamar Jackson, who has just finished his rookie contract with the Baltimore Ravens, Smith spoke of the advantages of building around Ridder and his rookie contract.

            “When you have that opportunity, that’s the perfect set of circumstances,” Blank said. “The perfect storm, if you will, in a positive way, not a negative way. When you have a quarterback who you draft and have for four or five years, that’s a really big deal.”











            After trading quarterback Matt Ryan to Indianapolis in March, the Falcons were burdened by a record $63 million in dead cap space in the 2022 season but will have a replenished budget for free agency this offseason. 

            Using the Super Bowl setting in Phoenix to support his stance, Blank did not sound enthusiastic about the option of again devoting an unhealthy portion of the team's payroll to one position.

            “In the history of the Super Bowl, there hasn’t been one quarterback that represented 20% or more of the roster compensation,” Blank said. “So we were actually at that point with Matt.”

            Blank said a future with Ridder at quarterback would present ""a unique opportunity, a unique window there, and even once you’re beyond that, in the second contract, you want to make sure you do it in a balanced, thoughtful way so you can build a roster.

            “As good as a quarterback may be, and they’re certainly a big part of a winning formula, they can’t play by themselves. There’s 21 other (starters) that need to play as well so we’re committed to the position obviously and we know we need to think about it and I think we have already.”

            The Falcons opened the season with Marcus Mariota at quarterback before Ridder started the final four games in the run-first offense. Atlanta was 2-2 in Ridder's starts. He completed 63.5% of his passes for 708 yards with two touchdowns and no interceptions.

            While the team will need to add depth at quarterback, Blank expressed optimism about building around Ridder as the starter. Smith hasn't committed to Ridder as next season's starter, hinting of a decision yet to be made.

            Blank sounded excited about Ridder's future.

            “I would say this is true of the whole organization, I think we’re very excited about Desmond Ridder,” Blank said.

            “From my viewpoint, these last four games he played better in each of the games. ... Having zero interceptions is a big deal in the NFL.""

            The Falcons will be looking to end a streak of five straight losing seasons in 2023, the third season with general manager Terry Fontenot and Smith. They will have the No. 8 pick in this year’s NFL draft.

            Blank said he's looking for improvement after having no more than seven wins in five consecutive seasons. 

            “I would say my expectations in terms of competitiveness would be higher,” Blank said. ""I think coach would tell you that and Terry would tell you that. If it’s higher, that should translate to more wins.

            “We have a lot of young players that have developed at a very nice level and really have their best capabilities going forward, so I feel good about where we are. And I think we have every reason as a fan and an owner to feel better about our team than we have in the last couple of years.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804669,California health program successfully cut hospital visits,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — A five-year experiment aimed at improving care for some of California's most at-risk Medicaid patients — including homeless people and people with severe drug addictions — resulted in fewer hospitalizations and emergency room visits that saved taxpayers an estimated $383 per patient per year, according to a review released Wednesday.

            The UCLA Center for Health Policy Research said that for every 1,000 people enrolled in California's Whole Person Care pilot program, there were 45 fewer hospitalizations and 130 fewer ER visits when compared with a similar group of patients who were not in the program.

            California has the largest Medicaid program in the country, with about 13 million people getting free health care from the government. That's about one-third of the state's population.











            In 2016, the state launched an experiment focused on the most at-risk Medicaid patients, those who were prone to expensive, repeated hospital visits but whose conditions rarely improved. These included people who were homeless or at risk of becoming homeless, people recently released from prison, people with multiple chronic health conditions and patients with severe drug addiction or mental health problems.

            These programs focused not just on a person's medical care, but also things like transportation, education, legal assistance and help finding and keeping a job. The program did not pay for people's housing, but it did pay for things to help them get housing — including money to cover security deposits, first month's rent, furniture and moving expenses.

            Sacramento Covered, a nonprofit that works to connect people with social services in California's capital, partnered with the local housing authority to find people places to live. Kelly Bennett, the group's CEO, said it was often difficult to find housing in a competitive rental market, but having money to cover a security deposit increased the likelihood of success.

            Beyond the housing assistance, Bennett said people got the most help from community health workers, who can guide patients through “all these various systems that are siloed and challenging under the best of circumstances.” 

            “Community health workers are really brokers of services and really grease the wheels, so to speak, on behalf of their clients,” she said.

            Different groups had vastly different results. The program was much better at reducing emergency room visits and hospitalizations for people who were homeless, addicted to drugs or had serious mental health issues than it was for patients who had complex medical issues. But the program was better at reducing the overall costs for people with complex medical issues, saving an average of $511 per patient per year.

            “The results show that such programs help complex patients in different ways, depending on their needs,” said Nadereh Pourat, associate director of the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research. ""Most importantly, our findings highlight the overall success of the Whole Person Care program and its potential for improving the lives of high-risk patients.”​

            Overall, the program cost $3.6 billion covering 25 pilot programs in 26 counties that served close to 250,000 patients — of which 70% had serious mental illness, drug addictions or were homeless.

            The pilot programs ended in December 2021. But California is already expanding the services statewide, part of a larger overhaul of the state's Medicaid program known as CalAIM — or California Advancing and Innovating Medi-Cal.SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — A five-year experiment aimed at improving care for some of California's most at-risk Medicaid patients — including homeless people and people with severe drug addictions — resulted in fewer hospitalizations and emergency room visits that saved taxpayers an estimated $383 per patient per year, according to a review released Wednesday.The UCLA Center for Health Policy Research said that for every 1,000 people enrolled in California's Whole Person Care pilot program, there were 45 fewer hospitalizations and 130 fewer ER visits when compared with a similar group of patients who were not in the program.California has the largest Medicaid program in the country, with about 13 million people getting free health care from the government. That's about one-third of the state's population.In 2016, the state launched an experiment focused on the most at-risk Medicaid patients, those who were prone to expensive, repeated hospital visits but whose conditions rarely improved. These included people who were homeless or at risk of becoming homeless, people recently released from prison, people with multiple chronic health conditions and patients with severe drug addiction or mental health problems.These programs focused not just on a person's medical care, but also things like transportation, education, legal assistance and help finding and keeping a job. The program did not pay for people's housing, but it did pay for things to help them get housing — including money to cover security deposits, first month's rent, furniture and moving expenses.Sacramento Covered, a nonprofit that works to connect people with social services in California's capital, partnered with the local housing authority to find people places to live. Kelly Bennett, the group's CEO, said it was often difficult to find housing in a competitive rental market, but having money to cover a security deposit increased the likelihood of success.Beyond the housing assistance, Bennett said people got the most help from community health workers, who can guide patients through “all these various systems that are siloed and challenging under the best of circumstances.”“Community health workers are really brokers of services and really grease the wheels, so to speak, on behalf of their clients,” she said.Different groups had vastly different results.

Gavin Newsom commuted his sentence. 

            Rahsaan “New York” Thomas, 52, left the lockup near San Francisco and was greeted by his fellow podcast co-hosts Walter “Earlonne” Woods, who was freed in 2019, and Nigel Poor. 

            “We’re thrilled to welcome him home,” the podcast posted on its Twitter feed, along with photos of Thomas











            Thomas’ sentence was commuted by Newsom in Jan. 2022 and the state parole board granted his release on parole in August. 

            “While in prison, Mr. Thomas has dedicated himself to his rehabilitation,” Newsom wrote in the commutation. 

            Thomas was serving a 55 1/2 years-to-life sentence for a second-degree murder conviction in 2000 and related charges after he fatally shot one victim and injured another during a drug deal. A Los Angeles County jury rejected his self-defense claim that he fatally shot a man who was trying to rob him.

            Since 2019, Thomas has been a co-producer and co-host of “Ear Hustle""— named after prison slang for eavesdropping. He was also a regular contributor to the San Quentin News, along with publications outside prison walls. He served as chairman of the Society of Professional Journalists' San Quentin satellite chapter and worked with several criminal justice reform groups.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804673,Twitter scrambles to fix meltdown as many unable to tweet,"Many Twitter users found themselves unable to tweet, follow accounts or access their direct messages on Wednesday as the Elon Musk-owned platform experienced a slew of widespread technical problems. 

            “Twitter may not be working as expected for some of you. Sorry for the trouble. We’re aware and working to get this fixed,” the company tweeted from its “support” account. 

            Further details were unavailable Wednesday and an email seeking comment from the company's press account went unanswered. Twitter has dissolved its media relations team. 











            Users first noticed the problem when they tried to send tweets and received a message saying they had reached their “tweet limit.” 

            While Twitter has for years limited the number of tweets an account can send, it is 2,400 per day — or 100 an hour — far more than most regular, human-run accounts send on the platform.

            Users also had trouble when they tried to follow another Twitter user, getting a message “You are unable to follow more people at this time"" with a link to the company's policy on follow limits. 

            Twitter's long-standing limit on how many accounts a single user can follow in a single day is 400 — again, more than a regular Twitter user would generally reach on any given day.

            It is not clear what caused Wednesday's meltdown, but Twitter engineers and experts have been warning that the platform is at an increased risk of fraying since Musk fired most of the people who worked on keeping it running.

            Already in November, engineers who left Twitter described for The Associated Press why they expect considerable unpleasantness for Twitter’s more than 230 million users now that well over two-thirds of the San Francisco-based company’s pre-Musk core services engineers are apparently gone. 

            While they don’t anticipate near-term collapse, the engineers said Twitter could get very rough at the edges — especially if Musk makes major changes without much off-platform testing.

            One Twitter engineer, who had worked in core services, told the AP in November that engineering team clusters were down from about 15 people pre-Musk — not including team leaders, who were all laid off — to three or four before even more resignations.

            Then more institutional knowledge that can’t be replaced overnight walked out the door.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804686,Court upholds Wash. residency requirement for pot industry,"SEATTLE (AP) — A U.S. judge has upheld Washington's residency requirement for involvement in the state's legal cannabis industry — a decision at odds with a federal appeals court ruling concerning a similar requirement in Maine.

            A man who co-owns a chain of Washington cannabis stores called Zips, Scott Atkinson, wanted to transfer part of his ownership interest to a longtime friend who lives in Idaho, Todd Brinkmeyer. Atkinson has been treated for cancer and said he hoped Brinkmeyer would help take over the business should his health deteriorate.

            But Washington requires owners and investors in regulated marijuana businesses to have lived in the state for at least six months, and Brinkmeyer said he has no intention of moving.











            Brinkmeyer sued the Washington Liquor and Cannabis Board in 2020, arguing that the residency requirement was unconstitutional because it interferes with interstate commerce — which is the purview of Congress — and discriminates against him as an out-of-state resident.

            U.S. District Judge Benjamin Settle in Tacoma disagreed in a ruling issued Monday. He found that the residency requirement couldn't interfere with interstate commerce because there is no legal interstate commerce in marijuana — the drug remains illegal under federal law.

            “Although Washington’s ‘legalization’ of cannabis certainly does not align with Congress’s intent, the residency requirements do,” Settle wrote. “The residency requirements attempt to prevent any interstate commerce in cannabis and to prevent cannabis from Washington from moving into states where it remains illegal, like Idaho.”

            Further, Settle ruled, Washington was not discriminating against Brinkmeyer as an out-of-state resident under the Constitution's “Privileges and Immunities Clause” because “it has never been established that there is any right ... to engage in illegal commerce.”

            The ruling was at odds with a decision from a federal court judge in Maine who struck down a residency requirement in that state's medical marijuana program. The First U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals — so far the only federal appeals court to consider the matter — upheld that ruling last summer, saying that whether legal or not, there is interstate commerce in marijuana, and it's up to Congress to regulate it.

            Dan Oates, an attorney for Brinkmeyer, said in an email Tuesday they were evaluating whether to appeal Settle's order.

            “It is unfortunate, particularly because, as the court acknowledged, the ruling stands in stark contrast to the majority of rulings by other federal courts on this same issue,” Oates said.

            Washington and Colorado in 2012 became the first U.S. states to legalize the recreational use of cannabis for adults. Washington limited investment in and ownership of its licensed cannabis businesses to within the state, largely in hopes of persuading the U.S. Justice Department not to challenge its legal marijuana law in court.

            Two Washington cannabis industry groups — the Washington CannaBusiness Alliance and the Craft Cannabis Coalition — urged the court to strike down the residency requirement, saying it unfairly limits access to investment.

            “The livelihoods of thousands of citizens depend on this industry,” the groups wrote. “These citizens are adversely affected by the State’s exclusionary and protectionist policies that restrict their ability to raise capital and grow their businesses.”SEATTLE (AP) — A U.S. judge has upheld Washington's residency requirement for involvement in the state's legal cannabis industry — a decision at odds with a federal appeals court ruling concerning a similar requirement in Maine.A man who co-owns a chain of Washington cannabis stores called Zips, Scott Atkinson, wanted to transfer part of his ownership interest to a longtime friend who lives in Idaho, Todd Brinkmeyer.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804687,Irving set for Mavericks debut without injured Doncic,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Kyrie Irving started in his debut with the Dallas Mavericks against the Los Angeles Clippers on Wednesday night.

            The eight-time All-Star was traded to the Mavs on Sunday from the Brooklyn Nets.

            Irving was a hit with fans, who cheered when he took the court for pre-game warmups. Several young boys shouted his first name over and over. They squealed when he acknowledged them. Adults held up camera phones to capture Irving in his blue T-shirt and sweatpants.











            Wearing red headphones, Irving put up shots on the Crypto.com Arena court a couple hours before tipoff. He will be limited to 34 to 36 minutes, coach Jason Kidd said.

            ""We’ll see how this goes tonight,” Kidd said. “It’s a work in progress.”

            Irving joins JaVale McGee and Markieff Morris as the veterans on the team. The Mavs have 11 players with six years or less of experience on the roster.

            “Leadership is something that we've talked about,” Kidd said. “I know he's new but he's a vet and these guys all look up to him, so his voice is important and they trust him.”

            Irving won’t be playing alongside Mavs superstar Luka Doncic, at least to start. Doncic missed his third straight game Wednesday night because of a right heel contusion. However, he joined the team in Los Angeles and it's under discussion whether he will play Friday or Saturday when the Mavs are at Sacramento for back-to-back games.

            Kidd compared the backcourt of Doncic and Irving to when Irving and LeBron James won a championship together in Cleveland. 

            “Luka and Kyrie, it's dangerous,” Kidd said. “They can score the ball, their IQs for basketball is extremely high, they understand what it takes to win and they're about winning.”

            Irving went from the fifth-place Nets in the East to the sixth-place Mavericks, who had a 29-26 record in the West going into Wednesday night.

            Irving hasn't played in a week. He scored 20 points in Brooklyn's loss at Boston on Feb. 1 and soon after asked for a trade. The Nets quickly unloaded him, ending a drama-filled tenure that began in 2019. 

            The last time Irving faced the Clippers he was with the Nets on Feb. 21, 2021. He scored 28 points and had eight assists in a 112-108 victory.

            “Much like Doncic, he’s going to have the ball in his hands a lot, we anticipate,” Clippers assistant Brian Shaw said. “We’re going to have to pay great attention to him and try to keep him under control.”

Several young boys shouted his first name over and over. They squealed when he acknowledged them. Adults held up camera phones to capture Irving in his blue T-shirt and sweatpants.Wearing red headphones, Irving put up shots on the Crypto.com Arena court a couple hours before tipoff.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804688,Minnesota woman convicted of killing 6-year-old son,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A Minnesota woman who asked a store clerk for ammunition that would “blow the biggest hole"" was found guilty Wednesday of fatally shooting her 6-year-old son just 10 days after regaining full custody of him, in a case that raised questions about the conduct of child welfare workers. 

            Jurors in Hennepin County District Court deliberated for less than two hours before finding Julissa Thaler, a 29-year-old Spring Park woman with a history of mental illness and drug abuse, guilty of first-degree murder in the death of Eli Hart. 

            The charge carries a mandatory sentence of life in prison. Sentencing is scheduled for Feb. 16. 











            Investigators said Eli was shot inside his mother's car in a parking lot at Lake Minnetonka Regional Park in Minnetrista. Police found the body in the trunk May 20 after pulling her over for a traffic violation. 

            During closing arguments, defense lawyer Bryan Leary said she participated in the boy’s death but was not the one who shot him. He said no eyewitnesses, photos or videos connected her to the killing, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported. 

            “She’s not charged with the crime they have proved,” Leary said. “She destroyed evidence, lied to police, ran away, but they have not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the gun was in her hands when it was fired nine times into her son.”

            Thaler did not testify, and her defense called no witnesses. 

            Assistant Hennepin County Attorney Dan Allard said overwhelming evidence, including cellphone data linking her to all the sites involved in the death, showed Thaler killed her son, either for life insurance money, because of her mental health or after the stress of a custody battle with the boy's father.

            He noted that the boy's DNA was found in Thaler’s hair and on her skin and clothes. If if she didn't shoot him, Allard said, why didn’t she tell police when pulled over, “Oh my God, someone shot my son — he’s in the trunk!” 

            Her ex-boyfriend, Tory Hart, a bait and tackle shop manager from Chetek, Wisconsin, has filed a lawsuit alleging that child welfare workers ignored warning signs before his son’s death. He had filed a petition seeking custody shortly before the killing and at trial told jurors his son was “everything to me."" 

            Hart's lawsuit and other documents obtained by the Star Tribune spell out a string of issues. 

            Among other things, police responded to Thaler's Farmington home 21 times in 10 months, she was arrested for stealing drugs from a health clinic and had to find a new drug-testing facility because of “bizarre behavior.”

            Thaler lost custody of Eli twice, first in October 2020 and then for most of 2021. 

            Robert Pikkarainen, another ex-boyfriend of Thaler, testified at trial that she and Eli had an argument the night before he died because he didn't want to go to bed. 

            She left the apartment and put a recently purchased shotgun in the car, grabbed her son and went downstairs, he said. 

            Pikkarainen, who was not charged, said he fell asleep and asked where she had gone when he woke up the next morning.

            “She was kind of like, ‘I had to go do something,’” Pikkarainen said.

            Later that day Thaler was stopped while driving with one tire completely gone, the rim scraping the road and the back windshield blown out. 

            Officers escorted her home before they continued searching her vehicle.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804689,Biden's State of the Union draws audience of 27.3 million,"NEW YORK (AP) — An estimated 27.3 million people watched President Joe Biden's State of the Union address on television, the second smallest audience for the annual event in at least 30 years, the Nielsen company said on Wednesday.

            It was also down nearly 28% from the 38.2 million people who saw Biden's address in 2022.

            The only smaller audience since 1993 was the 26.9 million who watched Biden's address to Congress in 2021 — not officially a State of the Union speech, since he had just taken office a few months earlier. That speech was delivered on the unusually late date of April 28.











            Nielsen did not have figures available from before President Bill Clinton's first address to Congress, which reached 66.9 million people in 1993, when entertainment options were fewer.

            Nearly three-quarters (73%) of the people who watched Biden's speech were 55 and older, Nielsen said. Only 5% were young adults under age 35.

            The speech was carried live on 16 television networks. 

            Biden's largest audience came on Fox News Channel, where the speech was seen by 4.69 million people, Nielsen said. ABC had 4.41 million viewers for Biden, NBC had 3.78 million, CBS had 3.64 million, MSNBC had 3.55 million, CNN had 2.4 million and the Fox broadcast network had 1.66 million.NEW YORK (AP) — An estimated 27.3 million people watched President Joe Biden's State of the Union address on television, the second smallest audience for the annual event in at least 30 years, the Nielsen company said on Wednesday.It was also down nearly 28% from the 38.2 million people who saw Biden's address in 2022.The only smaller audience since 1993 was the 26.9 million who watched Biden's address to Congress in 2021 — not officially a State of the Union speech, since he had just taken office a few months earlier.

From the moment I got elected, how many of the experts are saying within the next six months there's gonna be recession?""Economists for months have been warning of a possible recession as the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates in order to tame decades-high inflation.Biden himself has said a recession was possible, and earlier this week he told reporters that the risk was very low.On the whole, economic data in recent months has moved in the president's favor, particularly after inflation spiked to a 40-year high last summer and government reports showed the U.S. economy could be heading into a recession.Strong job numbers last week, which occurred despite layoffs in the technology sector as well as in interest-rate-sensitive sectors like housing and finance, poured cold water on market expectations that the U.S. central bank was close to pausing its monetary policy tightening cycle.",2023/2/9,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804692,The latest CSR trend in fintech: how technological companies help build a more sustainable future,"KUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA -  Media OutReach - 9 February 2023 - Winston Churchill famously said: ‘We make a living by what we get, but we make a life by what we give.’ This approach seems to be behind the global transformation of businesses towards a more society-oriented model that tries to ensure that the local community and, more broadly, the world thrives. With that aim in view, some companies effectively reduce their carbon footprint. For instance, Mercedes-Benz Group’s Ambition 2039 strategy involves shifting to a fully electric vehicle fleet. Other companies aim to support local communities facing challenges often related to education, infrastructure, and environmental conditions.            What does this trend, or rather a new societal norm, have to do with fintech companies? In what ways can they help, and what actions do they already take to improve our world? This article aims to answer these questions for emerging and already established fintech companies, as well as for their clients.   Fintech companies and corporate social responsibility   Fintech companies can advance social causes in several unique ways: from bringing financial services to people who have not had access to them to promoting financial literacy. Here are some of the most pressing issues fintech companies are already addressing:         Giving made easier. Some companies, such as Fidelity Charitable, present an opportunity to contribute cash, securities, and other assets to donor-advised funds at public charities. This makes it possible to increase tax savings for donators. Others, like Binance Charity, attempt to revolutionise global giving by employing Web3 technology, which makes donations more transparent, efficient, and, most importantly, direct.            Serving the underserved. Financial exclusion in rural and underdeveloped areas has become a major issue many fintech companies decide to centre their CSR activities around. In some cases, the whole purpose for creating a fintech service is built around bridging this gap. For instance, the mobile financial service bKash was specifically designed to cater for the 70% of the Bangladesh population who live in rural areas and have limited access to formal banking.            Advancing financial literacy. Unfortunately, few schools teach banking, investments, and savings, while those are some of the most important skills students might need in their adult life. Fintech companies become increasingly aware of the issue and start developing educational courses that serve their clients and a much wider audience.         Other charitable activities major fintech companies are involved in include environmental projects, such as HSBC’s efforts to help preserve Taipei’s Guandu Nature Park in Taiwan, emergency aid and various initiatives corresponding to the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals.   What can just one fintech company do to advance social causes worldwide?   Let’s take one fintech company to illustrate the CSR approach in fintech and its impact. In 2022, the international Forex broker OctaFX directed its efforts at helping local communities overcome global challenges. Here’s what it managed to accomplish:         The broker helped 1855 people and 46 small businesses in emergency situations, mostly during natural disasters.            OctaFX supported educational efforts of 4452 students and 50 schools and organisations by funding scholarships, extracurricular educational workshops, professional courses, renovating and building new schools and classes, purchasing computers and other necessary educational equipment.        In total, OctaFX helped more than 6000 people across multiple countries, including India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, Nigeria, and Pakistan. Some of the most impressive projects included the following:         In India, the broker helped construct six computer classrooms for the Lala Bulaki Das Babu Ram Sahai Hindu Mahila Inter College in Tilhar.            In Malaysia, OctaFX provided twelve-month allowances to six students pursuing different degrees in Malaysian universities.            In Indonesia, the broker provided humanitarian aid for families affected by an earthquake in Cianjur district, which left 58,362 people hurt and displaced.            In Pakistan, OctaFX financed the Health, Education and Safety (HES) project, which aimed at improving the health, education, and safety of children in twelve rural areas of Muzzafargarh, Punjab.            In Nigeria, OctaFX provided fifty unemployed youths with ICT training as part of the charitable project Youth Employability Skills (YES).            In Mexico, the broker is currently sponsoring Empowerment Program, which is going to benefit 110 elementary school students in Fundación Dr. José María Álvarez I.A.P.         The current CSR trend in the fintech industry is set to expand, while both stakeholders and employees expect their values to align with those of their companies. As more companies start to actively participate in socially beneficial projects, we become yet closer to a more sustainable, educated, and healthy future for the world.  Hashtag: #OctaFX
