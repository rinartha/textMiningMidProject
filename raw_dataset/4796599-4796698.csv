https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796599,S. Dakota lawmakers push bill to bar transgender youth care,"PIERRE, S.D. (AP) — A state House committee voted Tuesday to advance a bill that would ban gender-affirming care for transgender youth in South Dakota.

            Supporters argued a bill barring youth from accessing puberty blockers, hormones and surgery would protect adolescents from irreversible damage, while opponents argued it only blocks them from becoming their authentic selves. 

            Republican Rep. Bethany Soye’s bill passed through a House committee on health and human services Tuesday morning with a dominant vote from Republicans. Despite testimonies from health care providers, legal advocates and transgender youth, the bill will move on to a vote in the Republican-dominated House. Soye said she had Gov. Kristi Noem's support for the bill, which targets transgender individuals below the age of 18. 











            After nearly two hours of discussion, all eight Republicans on the committee voted for the bill, while the only two Democrats opposed it, adding South Dakota to the list of at least 18 other states pushing legislation to block transgender youth health care this year. 

            Utah’s Republican governor signeda ban on gender-affirming care last week, and similar bans have passed in Arkansas and Alabama, but they are being challenged in court.

            Testifiers in support of the bill spoke from personal experience, either as patients who regretted decisions to undergo surgery as young adults experiencing gender dysphoria, or as doctors who argued “normal” puberty was a “cure” for gender dysphoria.

            Don Oliver, a retired pediatrician from Rapid City, said he disagreed with guidance from leading medical associations — such as the American Medical Association — that support gender-affirming care as medically necessary.

            “We as a profession have lost our way, lost our bearing, lost our anchor,” Oliver said.

            Opponents criticized the bill on the grounds of overreach into healthcare concerns between patients and doctors, and for infringing on civil rights.

            “Gender-affirming care is part of comprehensive primary care,” said Daniel Heinemann, chief officer of Sanford Health and chair of South Dakota's American Academy of Family Physicians. “Family physicians are deeply concerned by the growing trend of recent legislative efforts to criminalize care directed at specific patient hospitalizations.” 

            Heinemann said gender diversity is a normal part of the human existence.

            Samantha Chapman, a member of the American Civil Liberties Union of South Dakota, said, “It is impossible to discriminate against a person for being transgender without discriminating against that individual based on sex.""

            Soye raised this bill as a matter of consent. She compared a child’s inability to consent to gender affirmation procedures to their inability to consent to purchasing cigarettes, drinking alcohol or joining the military. She also questioned the health care profession, saying, “the fact is the medical community can get things wrong.""

            Opponents to the bill noted that a young person's decision-making is heavily factored into the procedure of certifying treatment. 

            Dr. Anne Dilenschneider, a mental health care provider with New Idea Counseling, said gender dysphoria diagnoses take months. The process factors in a child's social skills, emotional skills, medical history and disabilities before addressing gender, and that involves reports from teachers and other certified adults close to the patient. 

            “This experience of gender dsyphoria or gender incongruence has to be marked and sustained over time, and that means years. This wasn't a kid who was on TikTok and says, ‘Hi, I’m trans,'"" Dilenschneider said.

            She added that the bill's misinformed language, such as “chemical castration,” upset her most. 

            Other opponents included 16-year-old Elliot Morehead of Sioux Falls, who skipped their physics test to testify at the Capitol.

            “I’m transgender and I’m proud,” Morehead said. 

            Morehead told the committee it took six months of therapy to receive a referral to simply discuss hormone therapy and other affirming treatments. They said telling children to grow out of gender dysphoria is like telling someone struggling with depression to “just be happy.”

            Democratic Reps. Kameron Nelson and Erin Healy opposed the bill for sex-based discrimination. They cautioned fellow voters the bill would cost the state and taxpayers millions of dollars spent in litigating a complete ruling. 

            Morehead was also disappointed in the committee's ruling but said they would remain optimistic. Despite having discussed leaving the state to pursue healthcare available to them, they want to keep up the fight. 

            “If we leave, the next generation is left behind,"" Morehead said. ""That's why I'm staying here and continuing to fight.""PIERRE, S.D.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796600,AP source: Broncos get Payton as coach in deal with Saints,"ENGLEWOOD, Colo. (AP) — The Denver Broncos have agreed to a deal with the New Orleans Saints that will make Sean Payton their head coach, a person with knowledge of the accord said Tuesday.

            The person, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the teams hadn't announced the agreement, said the Broncos would send their first-round pick, No. 29 overall, in this year's draft to the Saints along with a future second-rounder. Denver also will receive a third-round pick in the trade.

            Payton remained under contract with New Orleans after stepping down from the Saints last year and working in broadcasting this season.











            Payton, 59, went 152-89 in 15 seasons with the Saints and 9-8 in the playoffs. He led New Orleans to a 31-17 win over the Indianapolis Colts in the Super Bowl following the 2009 season. He stepped away last year when quarterback Drew Brees retired.

            The Broncos, who went 5-12 in 2022 and extended their playoff drought to seven years, fired rookie coach Nathaniel Hackett on Dec. 26 after he went 4-11. Interim coach Jerry Rosburg went 1-1.

            Payton's top task will be to get quarterback Russell Wilson back to his winning ways after the 11-year pro had his worst statistical season following his blockbuster trade from Seattle for four premium draft picks and three players.

            The Seahawks reached the playoffs under QB Geno Smith in their first year without Wilson, and now they own the Broncos' No. 5 overall selection in the draft in April.

            The Broncos got back into the first round by trading pass rusher Bradley Chubb at midseason to the Miami Dolphins, who sent the Broncos a first-rounder originally owned by the San Francisco 49ers.

            That selection, the 29th overall pick, now belongs to the Saints.

            Payton was the headliner during this year’s cycle of head coach openings. Just five teams were searching for coaches: the Broncos, Texans, Panthers, Colts and Cardinals.

            The Broncos conducted an extensive search, beginning with a virtual visit with Jim Harbaugh, who decided to stay at the University of Michigan. Also considered were Dan Quinn, DeMeco Ryans, Raheem Morris, Ejiro Evero, Jim Caldwell and David Shaw. The Texans hired Ryans on Tuesday.

            NFL rules didn't allow the Broncos to speak with Payton until Jan. 17, more than three weeks after they'd fired Hackett.

            Team owner and CEO Greg Penner led the search with assistance from limited partner Condoleezza Rice and general manager George Paton.

            Paton led last year’s search and landed on Hackett, one of several decisions that backfired on him in 2022 as Hackett became just the fifth head coach in NFL history not to survive his first season.

            Others were the $70 million contract he gave to free agent Randy Gregory, who played in six games and recorded a pair of sacks, and the $245 million contract extension he gave to Wilson before the opener.

            Wilson threw a career-low 16 touchdown passes and was sacked a league-leading and career-high 55 times in 15 games for Denver. He has vowed to do everything he can to bounce back in 2023.

            Wilson played well for two weeks under Rosburg, giving the team hope that his poor performances last season were an aberration and that maybe his skill set was just a bad fit in Hackett's offense.

            Penner, his wife, Carrie Walton-Penner, and her father, Rob Walton, purchased the Broncos last summer for $4.65 billion, a global record for a professional sports franchise. But the team turned out to be more of a fixer-upper than they expected.

            “When we purchased this great franchise in August, this is not the season we were expecting,” Penner said after firing Hackett. “I want to personally apologize to our fans and all of Broncos country. We know that we need to be better and we will.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796603,Newcastle reaches 1st cup final under Saudi ownership,"A club reborn after its Saudi-backed takeover, Newcastle is headed to a first cup final this century in a season that could also end with Champions League qualification.

            Newcastle beat Southampton 2-1 on Tuesday — despite a late red card for star midfielder Bruno Guimaraes — to seal a 3-1 aggregate victory in the English League Cup semifinals, thrilling the northeast team’s success-starved fans who waved black-and-white scarves while singing about going to Wembley Stadium.

            The final at English soccer’s national stadium is on Feb. 26 and Newcastle is likely to be facing Manchester United, which leads 3-0 from last week’s first leg at Nottingham Forest. Their return game is played Wednesday.











            Newcastle can expect more heady days over the next few years now that it has the richest owners in world soccer, having been bought by Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund 18 months ago.

            High-profile signings are sure to come, especially if Newcastle finishes in the top four of the Premier League — it is currently in third place — to get into the lucrative Champions League.

            Before that comes its first League Cup final since 1976, and a first trip to Wembley since the FA Cup final against Man United in 1999.

            “You want to be in finals of competitions to increase your status and make yourself more desirable for people to join,"" Newcastle manager Eddie Howe said. ""This is a club on the up.”

            The player pushing Newcastle into the final Tuesday was a local lad.

            Sean Longstaff, a 25-year-old midfielder from nearby North Shields, scored in the fifth and 21st minutes at a vibrant St. James’ Park to put Newcastle 3-0 ahead on aggregate, building on Joelinton’s winner in the first leg in Southampton last week.

            Longstaff drove home an angled shot for the first goal and then finished off a flowing team move — involving Joelinton, Joe Willock and Miguel Almiron — for an excellent second.

            “The place was bouncing and the energy they gave off was unbelievable,"" Longstaff said of Newcastle's fans. “They stuck with us through thick and thin and when times were not great and it was pretty bleak. I am so happy for them.”

            Che Adams pulled one back for the visitors from the south coast in the 29th, only the second goal Newcastle has conceded in all competitions since Nov. 6.

            But second-half pressure failed to yield another goal for Southampton, which eliminated Manchester City in the quarterfinals.

            Guimaraes was sent off in the 82nd minute for stamping on the lower leg of Southampton substitute Samuel Edozie. The initial awarding of a yellow card to the Brazil international was changed to a red after the referee viewed the incident on the pitchside monitor.

            Guimaraes will miss Newcastle's next three games — all of which are in the Premier League — but will be available for the final.

            Newcastle will head into next month's final looking to win its first major trophy since the FA Cup in 1955.

            BLACKBURN ADVANCES

            In the FA Cup, Blackburn beat fellow second-tier team Birmingham 1-0 in a fourth-round replay to set up a match against Leicester in the last 16.

            Birmingham defender Auston Trusty scored an own-goal in the first half of extra time.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796605,GM conditionally OKs $650M Nevada lithium mine investment,"RENO, Nev. (AP) — General Motors Co. has conditionally agreed to invest $650 million in Lithium Americas Corp. in a deal that will give GM exclusive access to the first phase of a mine planned near the Nevada-Oregon line with the largest known source of lithium in the U.S.

            The equity investment the companies announced jointly on Tuesday is contingent on the Thacker Pass project clearing the final environmental and legal challenges it faces in federal court in Reno, where conservationists and tribal leaders are suing to block it.

            Lawyers for the mining company and the U.S. government told a judge during a Jan. 5 hearing the project is critical to meeting the growing demand for lithium to make electric vehicle batteries — a key part of President Joe Biden’s push to expedite a transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy and help reduce greenhouse gas emissions.











            GM said Tuesday's announcement marks the largest-ever investment by an automaker to produce battery raw materials.

            Lithium Americas estimates the lithium extracted and processed from the project atop an ancient volcano about 200 miles (321 kilometers) northeast of Reno can support production of up to 1 million electric vehicles annually. It's the third largest known lithium deposit in the world, the company said.

            “The agreement with GM is a major milestone in moving Thacker Pass toward production,” Lithium Americas President and CEO Jonathan Evans said in the joint statement Tuesday.

            “We are pleased to have GM as our largest investor and we look forward to working together to accelerate the energy transition while spurring job creation and economic growth in America,” he said.

            GM also reported Tuesday that rising factory output led to strong U.S. sales at the end of last year, pushing its fourth-quarter net income up 16% over the same period a year ago.

            “GM has secured all the battery material we need to build more than 1 million EVs annually in North America in 2025 and our future production will increasingly draw from domestic resources like the site in Nevada we’re developing with Lithium Americas,” said GM Chair and CEO Mary Barra.

            The joint announcement said GM’s investment will be split into two portions. The first will be held in escrow “until certain conditions are met, including the outcome of the Record of Decision ruling currently pending in U.S. District Court.”

            “If those conditions are met, the funds will be released and GM will become a shareholder in Lithium Americas,” the joint statement said. 

            The escrow release is expected to occur no later than the end of 2023 and lithium production is projected to begin in the second half of 2026, it said.

            The second portion of the investment is contingent on, among other things, Lithium Americas “securing capital to fund the development expenditures to support Thacker Pass,” the statement said.

            Conservationists say the mine will destroy dwindling habitat for sage grouse, Lahontan cutthroat trout, pronghorn antelope and golden eagles, pollute the air and create a plume of toxic water beneath the open-pit mine deeper than the length of a football field.

            Tribal leaders say it will destroy nearby sacred lands where dozens of their ancestors were massacred by the U.S. Cavalry in 1865.

            U.S. District Judge Miranda Du said after a three-hour hearing in Reno on Jan. 5 that she hoped to make a decision “in the next couple months” on how to proceed in the nearly two-year-old legal battle over the Bureau of Land Management’s approval of the mine.

            Lawyers for the company and the bureau insisted the project complies with U.S. laws and regulations. But they said that if Du determines it does not, she should stop short of vacating the agency’s approval and allow initial work at the site to begin as further reviews are initiated.

            Opponents said that should not occur because any environmental damage would be irreversible.

            U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., hailed GM’s announcement, which he said would boost his efforts to develop U.S.-made batteries for EVs and other uses. China currently controls about 80% of the world’s anode production and 75% of the world’s lithium-ion battery cells, Manchin said.

            “I’m old enough to remember ... 1974 when I was standing in line waiting to buy gas if it was my turn to buy gas to go to work,″ Manchin said Tuesday in a speech on the U.S. Senate floor. “I don’t intend to stand in line to wait for China to send a battery to make my car work. I just won’t do it. So this is why we are moving in the direction we are.″

            “The United States is the superpower of the world and to remain that status, you have to have energy independence and be secured of your own energy sources,″ Manchin said.RENO, Nev.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796606,Police settle Louisiana suit over 2020 beating of Black man,"SHREVEPORT, La. (AP) — A settlement has been reached in a lawsuit filed by a Black man who said police officers in a Louisiana city threw him to the ground, slammed his face into the sidewalk and detained him in a mental health unit in retaliation for criticizing the police. 

            Terms of the settlement between Brandon Kennedy and officials with the Shreveport Police Department weren’t released. 

            Kennedy’s case was filed as part of the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana’s Justice Lab program, which enlists the aid of private attorneys in suing over police abuses. 











            “Our client Brandon Kennedy endured a terrifying and dehumanizing ordeal, and we’re glad he’s receiving monetary compensation,” Nora Ahmed, ACLU of Louisiana legal director, said in a news release.

            ""We hope this settlement sends a message that when local law enforcement agencies violate the rights of the people they’re sworn to serve — we will hold them accountable,"" Ahmed said.

            Ahmed noted in an email that defense motions were denied that would have struck references in the lawsuit to the police department's record on use of force and statistics on disparities in the treatment of Black and white suspects. 

            “I think in light of everything happening with Nichols this is very significant because it is literally how policing is done in this country,” she said, referring to Tyre Nichols, whose death three days after he was beaten by police officers in Memphis resulted in five officers being fired and charged with second-degree murder. 

            The Shreveport Police Department did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. 

            Kennedy's lawsuit was filed in December of 2021. It said he was in a convenience store checkout line in December 2020 when he struck up a conversation with another customer. An officer overheard him express support for the Black Lives Matter movement and “his own negative experiences” with Shreveport police, according to the lawsuit. 

            The officer ordered Kennedy to step outside, according to the lawsuit. Once outside, the lawsuit said, Kennedy was complying with an order to walk away when the officer threw him to the ground, repeatedly slammed his head to the sidewalk and put his knee on Kennedy's back. Other officers who arrived did nothing to stop the violence but handcuffed Kennedy. 

            The suit said officers searched Kennedy and, after finding nothing incriminating, took him to a hospital psychiatric ward where he was held. The next morning, a psychiatrist said there was no basis to hold him and he was released.SHREVEPORT, La.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796607,Tennessee advances legislation to ban trans youth care,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Tennessee's Republican-dominant Legislature on Tuesday advanced a handful of proposals that would ban gender-affirming care for transgender youth and severely limit where drag shows can take place.

            The push in Tennessee comes as state lawmakers across the United States are introducing dozens of restriction s targeting LGBTQ people, even as critics warn that such proposals are discriminatory and harmful. 

            Tennessee in particular has been caught in the center of this conflict ever since video surfaced on social media last year of a Nashville doctor touting that gender-affirming procedures are “huge money makers"" for hospitals. 











            The video prompted calls by Tennessee’s Republican leaders for an investigation into Vanderbuilt University Medical Center, but to date, it’s unknown if any authorities have done so. The private nonprofit hospital said it had provided only a handful of gender-affirming surgeries to minors over the years but put a temporary pause on the procedures to review its policies.

            Meanwhile, GOP leaders have used the incident to try to expand Tennessee's ban on transgender medical treatment for children. These services have been available in the U.S. for more than a decade and are endorsed by major medical associations.

            If enacted, doctors would be prohibited from providing gender-affirming care to anyone under the age of 18, including prescribing puberty blockers and hormones. However, the legislation includes exceptions that would allow doctors to perform these medical services if they're treating an abnormality or if the patient's care had begun prior to July 1, 2023 — which is when the ban is proposed to go into effect — and the doctor believes ending the care would harm the patient.

            Advocates on both sides of the issue crowded hearing rooms Tuesday, as some claimed that the legislation was needed to prevent what they called “child abuse” while others warned that Tennessee taxpayers could end up footing the bill if a court found the ban illegal. 

            “This law will trigger strict or heightened scrutiny, and it will be your burden to defend it in court. Tennessee, like Alabama, Texas, and Arkansas, will not be able to do so,"" said Chase Strangio, deputy director for transgender justice with the American Civil Liberties Union's LGBT & HIV Project.

            However, Republican lawmakers appeared unmoved Tuesday by the warnings. 

            “Our preacher would say, ‘If you don’t know what you are, a boy or a girl, a male or a female, just go in the bathroom and take your clothes off and look in the mirror and you’ll find out. You’ll find what you are,’"" said Republican Rep. Paul Sherrell, whose remarks sparked shocked gasps and condemnation from those opposing the bill. 

            On Tuesday, the bill advanced out of a subcommittee. It still needs to clear additional committees and the GOP-controlled House and Senate chambers before it can be reviewed by Republican Gov. Bill Lee, who supports the legislation. 

            Meanwhile, Republican lawmakers also advanced legislation designed to limit where drag shows can take place by classifying them as an “adult cabaret performance.” The legislation doesn't explicitly include the words “drag show,” but instead the definition of adult cabaret in Tennessee's law would be expanded to include “male or female impersonators who provide entertainment that appeals to a prurient interest, or similar entertainers.”

            Prurient interest is not defined in the bill.

            In Tennessee and across the country, drag has been cast in a false light by right-wing activists and politicians who complain about the “sexualization” or “grooming” of children. Perpetrators of the false rhetoric can then cast themselves as saviors of children and try to frame anyone who disagrees as taking the side of child abusers.

            If approved, drag shows would be banned on public property and any place where they could be viewed by a child. Critics warn that the language is overly broad and could apply to drag performers walking around their own children at home.

            Drag does not typically involve nudity or stripping, which are more common in burlesque, a separate form of entertainment. Explicitly sexual and profane language is common in performances meant for adult audiences. These routines can consist of stand-up comedy that may be raunchy — or may pale in comparison with some mainstream comedians.NASHVILLE, Tenn.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796612,Does the EU have hijab bans?,"Across the European Union, the headscarves worn by some Muslim women have been hotly contested for years. Some nations claim hijab bans would tackle religious oppression and terrorism, while others argue bans would discriminate against women's rights and hamper integration.Some EU countries have already imposed strict bans on the burqa, a full body covering with mesh around the eyes so a woman can see; and the niqab, a face veil that only leaves the eyes free.Meanwhile, outright or partial bans on the hijab headscarf in educational institutions, the workplace and public spaces have also been imposed in some EU countries.According to a March 2022 report by the Open Society Justice Initiative — a group of lawyers advocating for human rights — such bans came into force after US policymakers declared a global war on terror in the wake of the 9/11 terror attacks, giving rise to suspicions around Muslims due to their attire.""The idea that Muslims as a group were the new 'enemy within,' with beliefs and practices reflecting values and norms inferior to those of Europe, acquired legitimacy across the political spectrum,"" the authors of the report wrote.Rumki Chowdhury, editor of the blog for the World Hijab Day Organization, shared a similar sentiment.""I had a tough time because I grew up in America and after 9/11 it was really difficult for me to even think about wearing a hijab because of all the propaganda that was going on around about how Muslims were the ones behind the big terror attacks. So I was scared of being discriminated against for wearing a hijab,"" said Chowdhury, who is now based in Stockholm, Sweden.""But in reality, it is a misconception because according to the Quran, if you kill one man, it's like killing mankind and I realized that what people were claiming about Muslims was not true. People were just looking for someone to blame. They were angry, sad and took it out on us and what we wore,"" she told DW.""I eventually got over what people thought about me wearing a hijab because to me, it has always been something that brings me closer to my lord, Allah,"" she added.After the 9/11 terror attacks in the United States, France became the first EU country to impose a ban on the burqa and niqab in public places in 2010, calling them a sign of oppression.Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark, Italy (in some localities), the Netherlands (in public places) and Spain (in some parts of Catalonia) followed suit. Germany on the other hand, remains divided on burqas and niqabs, with some states banning them in schools and public places, and others fearing bans could hinder integration.In July 2021, the European Court of Justice ruled that women could be fired from their jobs for refusing to remove their hijab if they work in a job that deals with the public.""A prohibition on wearing any visible form of expression of political, philosophical or religious beliefs in the workplace may be justified by the employer's need to present a neutral image toward customers or to prevent social disputes,"" said the ECJ judges. Their ruling came in response to a request from German judges who had upheld the right of two employers to fire two women who insisted on wearing their headscarves to work.But in October 2022, the ECJ ruled that EU companies may need to justify bans on wearing religious symbols. The court was responding to a case about a Muslim woman in Belgium who was told that she could not wear a hijab to work. The firm said the decision was part of a neutrality rule seeking to foster equality among employees.Asmaa el Idrissi, a lawyer and anti-discrimination consultant based in Bochum, Germany, told DW that such rules do not help companies grow and are discriminatory.""I had to deal with the the workplace hijab ban while I was at the Hessian Ministry of Justice in Germany, which told me I would be prevented from doing any practical exercises as a part of my court internship because of my headscarf,"" she said. ""That meant I was not allowed to sit next to the judge and was not allowed to see any witnesses from the front. I was also not allowed to participate in certain prosecutorial tasks, nor step into the role of a prosecutor or publicly represent the state prosecutor's office.""""But the hijab is a sign of identity and a tool of empowerment for me, so I took action against it and my case went up to the Federal Constitutional Court in Germany. The court ultimately found the ban to be constitutional — that doesn't help me, nor will it help companies pursuing diversity,"" she said.El Idrissi said companies in Europe need to do more than just provide ""lip service"" when it comes to diversity policies. ""If we want to change structural racism, then we must employ and support people from all backgrounds and not discriminate against them based on what they wear,"" she said.According to the  report by the Open Society Justice Initiative, in most EU countries bans and rules on face veils and headscarves have been promoted primarily by nationalist and far-right political parties. The report also noted that five EU states — Croatia, Cyprus, Greece, Poland and Portugal — have never publicly debated bans on head or face coverings.To counteract such attitudes, New Yorker Nazma Khan initiated the idea of marking February 1 as World Hijab Day (WHD) back in 2013, in recognition of the millions of Muslim women who choose to wear the hijab and live a life of modesty.""The whole point of marking this day in Europe and in the USA is to kind of say this is our choice and we should be able to choose what kind of clothing we want to wear. It's part of our individuality. It's fashion. This is what I want to wear,"" said World Hijab Day blog editor Chowdhury.""I know there's that fear of what it could represent. You know, according to mainstream media representation after 9/11, Islamophobia has been on the rise constantly, nonstop. So by acknowledging this day, we aim to counteract such rhetoric,"" she added.But while the hijab is viewed as a sign of religious freedom and identity for some women, in Iran, for instance, many women view it as a sign of religious oppression.Last year, when 22-year old Jina Mahsa Amini died in police custody after she was arrested by Iran's so-called morality police for the way she was wearing her hijab, protests erupted in Iran and across the world, with people condemning Iranian authorities' strict dress code for women.""Whatever is happening in Iran is very unfortunate and as women who wear the hijab, we support their cause because ultimately their protest is also for women to have the freedom of choice to wear what they want and express their individuality,"" said Chowdhury.Saye Skye, a human rights activist from Iran who shuttles between Toronto and Berlin, told DW that the EU also needs to do more when it comes to creating safe spaces for people to have conversations about wearing the hijab.""The hijab is a hot topic here in the West but there is a lack of understanding about what it means to women who wear it. In Iran, for the past 43 years, people have lost their lives for not wearing a hijab. In Afghanistan, the Taliban are imposing strict headscarf rules on Afghan women. So in these places it is a form of oppression for women. Meanwhile, there are also women who feel it is a part of their identity and a way to express themselves,"" said Skye.""So within the EU, a safe space to hear every part of the hijab debate is needed. It is important for governments to develop spaces where people can share their knowledge and experience of wearing the hijab,"" said Skye.""There is trauma on all sides,"" said Skye, referencing the people fighting for their freedom in Iran and Afghanistan, where the hijab can erase identity, and those who have fought to be able to wear a hijab to express their identity. ""So Europe needs to embrace this complexity and show support and solidarity, rather than impose bans without understanding the concept of the hijab.""Chowdhury echoed a similar view.""It's the 21st century and individuality is basically the new cool. So whether it's wearing the hijab, not wearing the hijab, European countries need to embrace people for who they are and give them the freedom of choice to wear what they want and express themselves freely,"" she said.Edited by: Jon Shelton",2023/01/31,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796614,"After tanks for Ukraine, are fighter jets next in line?","Kyiv scored a major coup last week in convincing Western allies — particularly a reluctant Germany — to send modern battle tanks to help fight off Russia. Ukraine now seems emboldened to renew its calls for fighter jets. Such pleas have fallen upon deaf ears up to now. Could that be about to change?Kyiv has been asking for fighter jets since soon after Russia launched its full-scale invasion last February. After the change of heart on tanks last week, Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov told Canadian broadcaster CBC he was optimistic that allies could supply jets. These would be a ""game changer,"" Reznikov said, adding that he expected intense discussions in the coming weeks. Ukraine's ambassador to Germany, Oleksii Makeiev, told DW in an interview on Monday that his country hadn't requested Berlin to provide any fighter jets — yet.Exactly which planes Kyiv would want and how many is not yet clear. Ukraine's deputy foreign minister, Andriy Melnyk, called recently for ""a powerful fighter jet coalition for Ukraine,"" comprising US-made F-16s and F-35s, Eurofighter, Tornado, Rafale and Gripen warplanes.F-16s are of particular interest, because many European countries are looking to replace these with newer F-35s, German Marshall Fund senior fellow Bruno Lete told DW. ""Unfortunately for Ukraine, many of the fighter jets that they had were destroyed in the very beginning of the military campaign in February 2022,"" he said, adding that the remaining ones are old, a mix from Soviet times. From Kyiv's perspective, fighter jets are the missing component of a full arsenal, according to Lete.Washington, Kyiv's biggest military backer in real terms, had previously opposed sending fighter jets. President Joe Biden said Monday he wouldn't provide them.Last March, the White House said allies providing Soviet-era MiG-29 aircraft, as requested by Kyiv, would not make a huge difference. Moreover such a move ""could result in significant Russian reaction that might increase the prospects of a military escalation with NATO,"" said John Kirby, then the spokesperson for the US Department of Defense.However, citing unnamed sources, news outlet Politico recently reported that some US military officials supported the transfer and were trying to convince Defense Department officials. The US also previously said it wouldn't send main battle tanks, and then changed its mind.German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has repeatedly shot down the prospect of Berlin sending jets in the past week. On Sunday, Scholz said that what was needed at present was a serious debate, not ""a bidding competition... in which perhaps domestic political motives play a bigger role than support for Ukraine,"" dpa news agency reported.French President Emmanuel Macron said Monday that ""nothing is ruled out"" in principle, but deliveries would have to be useful, given the long training time for such aircraft, and must not escalate the conflict, in comments carried by The Associated Press. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte similarly said there were ""no taboos"" in terms of what could be delivered, but that sending fighter jets would indeed be a massive step forward, AP reported.The reason Western allies have resisted sending fighter jets is because it increases Ukraine’s ability to encroach onto Russian territory. ""It's a very sensitive issue here to give that, because it would make it much more easy for Ukraine to actually attack targets inside Russia,"" Lete explained.

Poland, considered one of Ukraine's most ardent backers, has offered up its own MiG-29 jets in the past. On Monday, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki also did not rule out a possible supply of F-16s, AP reported. Morawiecki also said in remarks posted on his website that any such transfer would take place ""in complete coordination"" with NATO countries.If Western fighter jets were transferred to Ukraine, Moscow's reaction would likely be sharp. After Berlin announced it would send Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine, Moscow said Germany had abandoned its historic responsibility for Nazi crimes in Russia in World War II, and would compound suffering in the present conflict.""With the approval of the leadership of Germany, battle tanks with German crosses will again be sent to the 'eastern front', which will inevitably lead to the deaths of not only Russian soldiers, but also the civilian population,"" Russia's ambassador to Germany, Sergey Nechayev, said last week. Such moves make the future normalization of relations much more difficult, Moscow has stressed.Lete thinks there is a strong chance that Western countries will send jets — even Germany. It wouldn't be the first time that red lines have been crossed, he said, pointing to the example of Leopard 2 tanks and before that to HIMARS rocket launchers.Berlin also looked to Washington for cues on the tank question. ""If the Americans are on board, I think Germany will be on board as well,"" he said.""We really now see that the West is ready to provide offensive weapons that Ukraine needs,"" Lete said. ""This political sensitivity [about delivering] capabilities that Ukraine could even use to attack Russia, even that red line is more and more fading away.”NATO boots on the ground in Ukraine remain a clear red line for Lete, as is of course the use of tactical nuclear weapons.Nonetheless, it is also worth remembering that there are significant logistical challenges linked to providing such military equipment. Ukraine said last week it would take its pilots about six months to train for combat in Western fighter jets such as F-16s.As the war drags on, Lete sees the debate shifting.""Since the start of the war, we've seen really two camps in Europe. You have one camp of countries that really wants Ukraine to win the war, and winning the war really means you have to defeat Russia. And then there's another camp of countries that wants peace and would be happy enough with some sort of settlement,"" he said. ""Right now the camp that wants to win the war, that really wants to push Russia back, is becoming more influential.""Edited by: Rob Mudge",2023/01/31,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796615,"Serbian, Croatian volunteers fight on Ukraine's front line","A red or white skull in a circle on a black background is the emblem of the notorious Russian paramilitary unit of mercenaries known as the Wagner Group. For years now, this private army has been intervening in conflicts around the world, spreading fear and terror in the process. In Ukraine too, it is fighting alongside the regular Russian army.Soon after the Russian invasion of Ukraine began on February 24, 2022, murals extolling the group appeared around the Serbian capital, Belgrade. Is the Wagner Group recruiting Serbian volunteers for the war in Ukraine?Videos doing the rounds on social media would appear to confirm that it is. These videos show Serbian fighters in Russian units in Ukraine. Speaking in Serbian, most of them talk about the training they received and their reasons for joining the war.The Serbian authorities have to date not commented on the videos, which critics say is out of consideration for the traditionally strong pro-Russian attitude in Serbia. This is also seen as the reason why Serbia, a candidate country for membership of the European Union, has not imposed sanctions on Russia.Serbian citizens have been actively involved in the conflict in Ukraine since the occupation and annexation of Crimea in 2014, even though Serbs are prohibited by law from serving in foreign armies.According to the Defense Ministry and security forces in Belgrade, information about Serbs fighting in Ukraine is carefully recorded. But just how many Serbian volunteers have been registered by the authorities has never been made public.The Ukrainian Embassy in Serbia estimated in 2019 that about 300 people from Serbia were fighting in the war that was already raging in eastern Ukraine at the time — all of them on the Russian side.Serbian security forces say over 30 people have been sentenced for participating in the Ukraine war. This has not prevented extreme right-wing organizations from drumming up support for the Wagner Group on social media.Yevgeny Prigozhin, founder of the Wagner Group, has denied it is recruiting fighters in Serbia. Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic has publicly condemned a now-deleted Wagner recruiting ad on the websites of the Serbian service of the Russian state-run media company Russia Today.The graffiti featuring the Wagner emblem in Belgrade has since been painted over, after protests by activists from the group calling itself Russians, Ukrainians, Belarusians and Serbs United against War. This group brings together citizens from Russia, Belarus and Ukraine who fled to Serbia to escape the regime of Russian President Vladimir Putin.Serbian anti-war activists have also brought charges against several civil servants, accusing them of not having prevented the recruitment of volunteers for the war in Ukraine. They have also been vocal in their opposition to various right-wing organizations in Serbia that they accuse of bolstering the image of the Wagner Group in public, which they say is an attempt to mobilize Serbian citizens for a war abroad and is, therefore, illegal.Croatia, one of Serbia's neighbors and a member of both the European Union and NATO, fully supports the EU's policy on Russia. Both the government in the capital, Zagreb, and most Croatians have supported Ukrainian citizens who fled to Croatia after the Russian invasion. Refugees even enjoy the same status as Croatian citizens on the labor market.Most of the Croatian men and women fighting in Ukraine are on the side of the Ukrainians. In the first half of 2022, private television channels broadcast interviews with several dozen people who had either joined the Ukrainian armed forces or were on their way to Ukraine to do so. Unofficial estimates put the number of Croatian citizens fighting in Ukraine at between 70 and 80.Interviews and other media reports suggest these are the same people who supported Ukraine at the start of the crisis in 2014. However, there has never been any official — and above all accurate — information about the number of Croatian volunteers who have traveled to Ukraine.According to Russian media, most of the fighters who have arrived in Ukraine from Croatia since last February joined the Azov Regiment. The Defense Ministry in Moscow puts the number at about 200.Denis Seler, the former leader of the fan group of the football club Dinamo Zagreb, who has repeatedly fought with Ukraine since 2014, believes this figure is too high.Moscow has described the right-wing extremist as the ""organizer of Croatian mercenaries"" in Ukraine. Speaking to the Croatian daily newspaper Vecernji list, Seler himself described his motivation for fighting in Ukraine as follows: ""In Ukraine, a battle is being fought for the white European race, its culture and history.""Croatian authorities have repeatedly emphasized that joining the war in Ukraine is an extremely risky endeavor and that citizens do so at their own risk. This explains why negotiations to secure the release of Vjekoslav Prebeg, a Croatian citizen fighting for Ukraine,who was captured by the Russians near Mariupol and tried by a Russian court, were so discreet. In September, he was able to return to Croatia as part of a prisoner exchange agreement.A handful of Croatian citizens have joined the war on the Russian side. The identity of only one of them is known to the public: Mirela Jakupanec is working as a medical orderly for the Russians. Some sources refer to her as a nurse, others as a doctor. Her pro-Russian statements have been disseminated mainly by sites that are known for spreading fake news and Kremlin propaganda.Despite all the solidarity with Kyiv, Ukrainian soldiers are not welcome in Croatia. The parliament in Zagreb rejected a government proposal to train Ukrainians on Croatian territory as part of the EU Military Assistance Mission in support of Ukraine. Opinion polls had previously indicated that almost 60% of Croats were opposed to the idea.In contrast to his government's stance, Croatian President Zoran Milanovic has publicly voiced the theory that the conflict is a proxy war between Washington and Moscow — a statement that earned him the praise of Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.This article was originally published in German.",2023/01/31,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796616,49ers head into offseason with more questions at quarterback,"SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) — The San Francisco 49ers head into another offseason with major questions at quarterback after a season filled with injuries to the most important position ended without any of them physically able to throw the the ball downfield.

            Trey Lance, who began the season as starter, is getting close to being fully cleared following two operations on his broken right ankle.

            Brock Purdy, who went from third-string rookie to the starter that helped lead the Niners into the NFC title game before getting hurt himself, is figuring out how to treat his injured throwing elbow.











            Jimmy Garoppolo, the starter in between those two before breaking his foot, is set to become an unrestricted free agent in six weeks.

            And rumors are sure to swirl about whether the best answer for coach Kyle Shanahan and general manager John Lynch will be adding a veteran like Tom Brady to help a franchise that has gone to the NFC title game or further in three of the last four seasons get over the hump and win its first Super Bowl in nearly three decades.

            The first big question at the position will be about Purdy's health after he tore the ulnar collateral ligament in his right elbow on the first drive of a 31-7 loss in the NFC title game to Philadelphia on Sunday.

            Purdy was forced back into the game in the second half when Josh Johnson left with a concussion but was unable to throw the ball more than a few yards because of the injury.

            “The minute I started throwing literally like I knew something was wrong. I couldn’t throw,” he said. “So obviously the adrenaline and stuff I think helps in terms of allowing me to go back in the game and hand the ball off — even that was pretty painful. But just overall it sucked that I wasn’t able to throw.”

            An MRI revealed the tear and Purdy said he will undergo more tests and speak to more doctors to figure out whether recovery, repair or full reconstruction is the best option.

            The injury is much more common in baseball pitchers, who often undergo reconstructive “Tommy John surgery"" that sidelines them up to a year. But Purdy is hoping to avoid that; a simpler repair would keep him out for six months but allow him to return to practice around the start of training camp in July.

            “The way a quarterback throws compared to a pitcher, two different things. It’s similar but more violent as a baseball player,” Purdy said. “So they’re saying the recovery process could be a little bit faster as a quarterback. I’ve looked at guys who have gone through this kind of thing. I’m just trying to find what’s right. Everyone’s situation is different and I’m trying to find out which one is right for myself.""

            Purdy showed a lot in his first season in the NFL, going from the last pick of the draft to starter in the conference title game. He won all seven of his starts before the loss on Sunday and threw for 1,374 yards with 13 touchdowns and only four interceptions in the regular season.

            That performance could make him the favorite to begin next season as starter if he's healthy.

            “For me to claim or say anything in terms of what’s going to happen moving forward, that’s out of my control,” he said. “I’m going to do what I can to get back healthy and be ready to compete come fall.”

            Lance was supposed to be in that role after San Francisco traded three first-round picks to draft him third overall in 2021. But he started only two games as a rookie when Garoppolo got hurt and then went down with a season-ending injury early in Week 2 this season.

            Lance needed a second operation in late December but said he expects to be fully cleared in a few weeks and to be 100% for the start of the offseason program.

            But after he started only five games combined in the last three years in college and the NFL, there are questions about whether Lance can be the long-term answer for San Francisco.

            “I’m excited to go out and show what I can do,” he said. “Same situation that it’s been for me the last two years and really my whole life. Nothing has really changed and I still have the same mindset. ... I just worry about what these guys think in this locker room, what the coaches think, what people in this organization think. Anything outside of that is totally out of my control. So I don’t let that have any effect on me.”

            NOTES: All-Pro DE Nick Bosa said he wants to sign a long-term contract to stay in San Francisco but will be patient and leave that up to his agent.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796617,UN expert: Myanmar junta will seek legitimacy in `sham' vote,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The independent U.N. special investigator on Myanmar warned Tuesday that the country’s military rulers plan to seek legitimacy by orchestrating a “sham” election this year and urged all countries to reject the illegal and “farcical"" vote.

            Tom Andrews also called for nations that support human rights and democracy to recognize the underground umbrella organization for opponents of military rule as the legitimate representative of Myanmar's people.

            He said in a report to the Human Rights Council released on the eve of the second anniversary of the ouster of Aung San Suu Kyi’s elected government that according to the constitution drafted by the military in 2008, its coup on Feb. 1, 2021, “was illegal and its claim as Myanmar’s government is illegitimate.”











            U.N. member nations, Andrews said, “have an important responsibility and role to play in determining whether Myanmar’s military junta will succeed in achieving its goal of being accepted as legitimate and gaining control of a nation in revolt.”

            “You cannot have a free and fair election when the opposition is arrested, detained, tortured, and executed,” journalists are prohibited from doing their job, and it is a crime to criticize the military, Andrews said at a news conference. 

            He noted that most of the international community has refused to accept the military’s claim to be the legitimate government of Myanmar. A small minority, including China, Russia, India, Belaurs, Saudi Arabia and Sri Lanka, have taken actions tantamount to recognition such as presenting diplomatic credentials to the junta leaders and strengthening military and economic relations, he said.

            Andrews called for recognition and support for the National Unity Government, the main underground group coordinating resistance to the military. It was established by elected legislators who were barred from taking their seats when the military seized power.

            Andrews said he is encouraged by the increasing engagement of the United States, the European Union and Canada with the National Unity Government.

            Presenting the report at a news conference, Andrews called Myanmar's situation “the forgotten war” and accused the international community of failing to address the crisis along with “the junta’s systematic crimes against humanity and war crimes.”

            Since the military came to power, he said, at least 2,900 people and probably many more have died, 17,500 people are political prisoners and at least 38,000 homes, clinics and schools have been burned to the ground. In addition, 1.1 million people have been displaced, more than 4 million children don’t have access to formal education, and 17.6 million people are expected to need humanitarian aid in 2023, up from 1 million before the coup, he said.

            Andrews, a former U.S. congressman who has appointments at the Yale Law School and Harvard’s Asia Center, said a new coordinated international response to the crisis in Myanmar is imperative.

            The army's ouster of Suu Kyi's elected government was met with widespread public protests that security forces suppressed with lethal force. The futility of nonviolent protest drove opponents to armed resistance, which some U.N. experts and others have characterized as civil war. 

            According to Andrews' report to the U.N. Human Rights Council, in the 22 months from the coup through Dec. 31, there were approximately 10,000 attacks or armed clashes between the military and anti-junta, ethnic resistance forces, and other groups.

            Andrews urged all members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to distance themselves from the junta, condemn its actions, and support enforcement of international sanctions. While Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines and Brunei have reduced diplomatic engagement and rejected its claims of legitimacy, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam have engaged with the military, though Vietnam and Cambodia have said this doesn’t equate to recognition.

            Myanmar is a member of ASEAN and its military leader, Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, agreed to the organization's five-point plan in April 2021 calling for an immediate cessation of violence, a dialogue among all concerned parties mediated by an ASEAN special envoy, but the junta has made little effort to implement it.

            Andrews said the military’s hold on the country “is weakening,” saying that his investigation has found that international sanctions have made it difficult for the junta to move and access funds to keep its operations going. But “the problem is that the sanctions are not coordinated,” he said.UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The independent U.N. special investigator on Myanmar warned Tuesday that the country’s military rulers plan to seek legitimacy by orchestrating a “sham” election this year and urged all countries to reject the illegal and “farcical"" vote.Tom Andrews also called for nations that support human rights and democracy to recognize the underground umbrella organization for opponents of military rule as the legitimate representative of Myanmar's people.He said in a report to the Human Rights Council released on the eve of the second anniversary of the ouster of Aung San Suu Kyi’s elected government that according to the constitution drafted by the military in 2008, its coup on Feb. 1, 2021, “was illegal and its claim as Myanmar’s government is illegitimate.”U.N. member nations, Andrews said, “have an important responsibility and role to play in determining whether Myanmar’s military junta will succeed in achieving its goal of being accepted as legitimate and gaining control of a nation in revolt.”“You cannot have a free and fair election when the opposition is arrested, detained, tortured, and executed,” journalists are prohibited from doing their job, and it is a crime to criticize the military, Andrews said at a news conference.He noted that most of the international community has refused to accept the military’s claim to be the legitimate government of Myanmar.

            Difficulty measuring methane slows plan to slash emissions

            NEW YORK (AP) — Satellites, drones and airplanes equipped with infrared cameras will likely be the backbone of a new federal policy to fine the nation’s largest methane polluters. But the nascent industry has a long way to go before it can accurately measure just how much methane polluters are releasing. And the nation’s new methane reduction program, which was passed as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, will allow the government to fine those polluters for methane emissions based on measurements taken in 2024. That leaves little time to get a reliable system in place.

            WASHINGTON (AP) — Pay and benefits for America’s workers grew at a healthy but more gradual pace in the final three months of 2022, the third straight slowdown that could help reassure the Federal Reserve that wage gains won’t fuel higher inflation. Wages and benefits, such as health insurance, grew 1% in the October-December quarter compared with the previous three months. That marked a solid gain, though it was slower than the 1.2% increase in the July-September quarter.

            SEATTLE (AP) — Boeing bids farewell to an icon on Tuesday: It’s delivering its final 747 jumbo jet. Since it debuted in 1969, the 747 has served as a cargo plane, a commercial aircraft capable of carrying nearly 500 passengers, and the Air Force One presidential aircraft. It revolutionized international travel. But over about the past 15 years, Boeing and its European rival Airbus have introduced more profitable and fuel efficient wide-body planes, with two engines instead of the 747′s four. The final plane is the 1,574th built by Boeing in the Puget Sound region of Washington state. It’s being delivered to cargo carrier Atlas Air.

            Unprecedented profit for Exxon as travel, and war, heated up

            NEW YORK (AP) — Exxon Mobil posted record annual profits in 2022 as consumers globally struggled with high prices for gasoline, home heating and consumer goods. The energy giant brought in $55.7 billion in annual profits. That exceeded its previous record of $45.22 billion in 2008. Exxon’s bounty came as Americans shelled out $4 per gallon for gasoline in the U.S. during the spring and summer. Oil and natural gas prices surged globally after Russia invaded Ukraine and reduced its supply of energy to Europe. The record profits were a marked turnaround from two years ago, when the coronavirus pandemic hit and travel ground to a halt, killing demand for fuels.

The company said Tuesday that global same-store sales __ or sales at stores open at least a year __ rose 12.6% in the October-December period. That beat Wall Street’s expectations. U.S. sales soared in October after McDonald’s launched adult Happy Meals featuring limited-edition toys designed by the streetwear brand Cactus Plant Flea Market.

            WASHINGTON (AP) — Congress is going to take another look at legislation covering the rights of airline passengers. Democratic Senators Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Edward Markey of Massachusetts said Tuesday they re-introduced bills to increase penalties when airlines strand or delay passengers, and to limit airline fees. Both ideas have failed in previous years, but the senators say they’ve got a good chance of success this time because of outrage over debacles like the one at Southwest Airlines in December. But they’ll face obstacles. Republicans haven’t supported the measures yet. And airlines have succeeded before in lobbying Congress against proposals to limit or regulate the fees that they charge customers for services like checking baggage.

            Alaska gold, copper mine blocked over environmental worries

            JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) — Federal environmental regulators have blocked a proposed Alaska mine heralded by backers as the most significant undeveloped copper and gold resource globally. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency took the unusually strong step Tuesday. It’s concerned about the mine’s environmental impact on a rich aquatic ecosystem that supports the world’s largest sockeye salmon fishery. Alaskan Native tribes and environmentalists celebrated Pebble Mine’s veto. But Pebble Limited Partnership CEO John Shively calls the move “unlawful” and says a lawsuit is likely. Tribes in the Bristol Bay region in 2010 petitioned the EPA to protect the area under the federal Clean Water Act.

The new AI Text Classifier launched by OpenAI follows a weeks-long discussion at schools and colleges over fears that ChatGPT’s ability to write just about anything on command could fuel academic dishonesty and hinder learning. OpenAI cautions that its new tool is not foolproof and the method for detecting AI-written text is imperfect and can be wrong at times.___Difficulty measuring methane slows plan to slash emissionsNEW YORK (AP) — Satellites, drones and airplanes equipped with infrared cameras will likely be the backbone of a new federal policy to fine the nation’s largest methane polluters. But the nascent industry has a long way to go before it can accurately measure just how much methane polluters are releasing. And the nation’s new methane reduction program, which was passed as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, will allow the government to fine those polluters for methane emissions based on measurements taken in 2024. That leaves little time to get a reliable system in place.___US wage growth slowed in the final quarter of 2022WASHINGTON (AP) — Pay and benefits for America’s workers grew at a healthy but more gradual pace in the final three months of 2022, the third straight slowdown that could help reassure the Federal Reserve that wage gains won’t fuel higher inflation. Wages and benefits, such as health insurance, grew 1% in the October-December quarter compared with the previous three months. That marked a solid gain, though it was slower than the 1.2% increase in the July-September quarter.___Boeing bids farewell to an icon, delivers last 747 jumbo jetSEATTLE (AP) — Boeing bids farewell to an icon on Tuesday: It’s delivering its final 747 jumbo jet. Since it debuted in 1969, the 747 has served as a cargo plane, a commercial aircraft capable of carrying nearly 500 passengers, and the Air Force One presidential aircraft. It revolutionized international travel. But over about the past 15 years, Boeing and its European rival Airbus have introduced more profitable and fuel efficient wide-body planes, with two engines instead of the 747′s four. The final plane is the 1,574th built by Boeing in the Puget Sound region of Washington state. It’s being delivered to cargo carrier Atlas Air.___Unprecedented profit for Exxon as travel, and war, heated upNEW YORK (AP) — Exxon Mobil posted record annual profits in 2022 as consumers globally struggled with high prices for gasoline, home heating and consumer goods. The energy giant brought in $55.7 billion in annual profits. That exceeded its previous record of $45.22 billion in 2008. Exxon’s bounty came as Americans shelled out $4 per gallon for gasoline in the U.S. during the spring and summer. Oil and natural gas prices surged globally after Russia invaded Ukraine and reduced its supply of energy to Europe. The record profits were a marked turnaround from two years ago, when the coronavirus pandemic hit and travel ground to a halt, killing demand for fuels.___Adult Happy Meals, McRib, feed McDonald’s sales in Q4CHICAGO (AP) — Adult Happy Meals and other limited-time promotions boosted traffic at McDonald’s restaurants during the fourth quarter despite higher prices. The company said Tuesday that global same-store sales __ or sales at stores open at least a year __ rose 12.6% in the October-December period. That beat Wall Street’s expectations. U.S. sales soared in October after McDonald’s launched adult Happy Meals featuring limited-edition toys designed by the streetwear brand Cactus Plant Flea Market. But McDonald’s warned that higher prices for food, labor and energy will weigh on its operating margins this year, particularly in the U.S. and Europe.___Wall Street climbs to add more to its strong JanuaryNEW YORK (AP) — Wall Street closed out a strong January with more gains. The S&P 500 rose 1.5% Tuesday, marking its third winning month in the last four. The Dow rose 1.1% and the Nasdaq rose 1.7%. The gains came ahead of what many investors hope will be one of the Federal Reserve’s last hikes to interest rates for a while. Markets got a boost after a report showed that growth for workers’ pay and benefits slowed during the end of 2022. While that’s frustrating for people trying to keep up with soaring prices, markets see it as an encouraging sign of easing pressure on inflation.___Lawmakers aim to raise penalties for US airline disruptionsWASHINGTON (AP) — Congress is going to take another look at legislation covering the rights of airline passengers. Democratic Senators Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Edward Markey of Massachusetts said Tuesday they re-introduced bills to increase penalties when airlines strand or delay passengers, and to limit airline fees. Both ideas have failed in previous years, but the senators say they’ve got a good chance of success this time because of outrage over debacles like the one at Southwest Airlines in December. But they’ll face obstacles. Republicans haven’t supported the measures yet. And airlines have succeeded before in lobbying Congress against proposals to limit or regulate the fees that they charge customers for services like checking baggage.___Alaska gold, copper mine blocked over environmental worriesJUNEAU, Alaska (AP) — Federal environmental regulators have blocked a proposed Alaska mine heralded by backers as the most significant undeveloped copper and gold resource globally.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796619,A real zoodunit: Monkeys found but mystery deepens in Dallas,"DALLAS (AP) — Two monkeys taken from the Dallas Zoo were found Tuesday in an abandoned home after going missing the day before from their enclosure, which had been cut. But no arrests have been made, deepening the mystery at the zoo that has included other cut fences, the escape of a small leopard and the suspicious death of an endangered vulture.

            Dallas police said they found the two emperor tamarin monkeys after getting a tip that they could be in an abandoned home in Lancaster, located just south of the zoo. The animals were located, safe, in a closet, and then returned to zoo for veterinary evaluation.

            Police said earlier Tuesday that they were still working to determine whether or not the incidents over the last few weeks are related. 











            Meanwhile, in Louisiana, officials were investigating after 12 squirrel monkeys were taken from a zoo there on Sunday and considering whether there could be a connection. 

            Here's what is known so far about the incidents:

            WHAT HAS HAPPENED AT THE DALLAS ZOO?

            The zoo closed Jan. 13 after workers arriving that morning found that the clouded leopard, named Nova, was missing. After a search that included police, the leopard weighing 20-25 pounds (9-11 kilograms) was found later that day near her habitat. 

            Police said a cutting tool was intentionally used to make the opening in her enclosure. A similar gash also was found in an enclosure for langur monkeys, though none got out or appeared harmed, police said.

            On Jan. 21, an endangered lappet-faced vulture named Pin was found dead by arriving workers. Gregg Hudson, the zoo's president and CEO, called the death “very suspicious” and said the vulture had “a wound,"" but declined to give further details.

            Hudson said in a news conference following Pin's death that the vulture enclosure didn't appear to be tampered with.

            On Monday police said the two emperor tamarin monkeys — which have long whiskers that look like a mustache — were believed to have been taken after someone cut an opening in their enclosure. 

            The following day police released a photo and video of a man they said they wanted to talk to about the monkeys. The photo shows a man eating Doritos chips while walking, and in the video clip he is seen walking down a path.

            WHAT COULD BE THE MOTIVE IN TAKING THE MONKEYS?

            Lynn Cuny, founder and president of Wildlife Rescue & Rehabilitation in Kendalia, Texas, said she wouldn’t be surprised if it turns out the monkeys were taken to be sold. Depending on the buyer, she said, a monkey like those could be sold for “several thousands” of dollars.

            “Primates are high-dollar animals in the wildlife pet trade in this country,” Cuny said. “Everybody that wants one wants one for all the wrong reasons — there’s never any good reason to have any wild animal as a pet.”

            She said there were a variety of ways the taken monkeys could have been in danger, from an improper diet to exposure to cold. Temperatures in Dallas dipped into the 20s on Tuesday during a winter storm.

            WHAT IS KNOWN ABOUT THE VULTURE?

            Pin's death has been hard on the staff, a zoo official said.

            The vulture was “a beloved member of the bird department,” according to Harrison Edell, the zoo’s executive vice president for animal care and conservation.

            Speaking at a news conference, Edell said Pin was at least 35 years old and had been at the zoo for 33 years. “A lot of our teams have worked closely with him for all of that time,” Edell said.

            Pin, one of four lappet-faced vultures at the zoo, was said to have sired 11 offspring, and his first grandchild hatched in early 2020.

            Edell said Pin's death was not only a personal loss but also a loss for the species, which “could potentially go extinct in our lifetime.” 

            WHAT IS KNOWN ABOUT SECURITY?

            Hudson, the zoo's CEO, said in a news conference following Pin’s death that normal operating procedures included over 100 cameras to monitor public, staff and exhibit areas, and that number had been increased. Overnight presence of security and staff was also raised. 

            Where possible, he said, zoo officials limited the ability of animals to go outside overnight.

            After Nova went missing, officials said they had reviewed surveillance video but not what it showed.

            The zoo was closed Tuesday and Wednesday due to the storm.

            WHAT HAPPENED IN LOUISIANA?

            The 12 squirrel monkeys were discovered missing Sunday from their enclosure at a zoo in the state's southeast.

            Their habitat at Zoosiana in Broussard, about 60 miles (96 kilometers) west of Baton Rouge, had been “compromised” and some damage was done to get in, city Police Chief Vance Olivier said Tuesday. He declined to provide further details on the damage, citing the ongoing investigation.

            He said police did not have any suspects yet but were still searching through video files.

            Zoosiana said in a Facebook post that the remaining monkeys have been assessed and appear unharmed.

            HAVE THERE BEEN OTHER INCIDENTS BEFORE AT THE DALLAS ZOO?

            In 2004, a 340-pound (154-kilogram) gorilla named Jabari jumped over a wall and went on a 40-minute rampage that injured three people before police shot and killed the animal.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796624,4 key suspects in Haiti presidential slaying in US custody,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — Four key suspects in the killing of Haitian President Jovenel Moïse were transferred to the United States for prosecution as the case stagnates in Haiti amid death threats that have spooked local judges, U.S. officials announced Tuesday.

            The suspects now in custody of the U.S. government include James Solages, 37, and Joseph Vincent, 57, two Haitian-Americans who were among the first arrested after Moïse was shot 12 times at his private home near the capital of Port-au-Prince on July, 7 2021.

            Also charged is Christian Emmanuel Sanon, an elderly pastor, doctor and failed businessman that authorities have identified as a key player. His associates have suggested he was duped by the real — and still unidentified — masterminds behind the assassination that has plunged Haiti deep into political chaos and unleashed a level of gang violence not seen in decades.











            The fourth suspect was identified as Colombian citizen Germán Rivera García, 44, who is among nearly two dozen former Colombian soldiers charged in the case. 

            Rivera, along with Solages and Vincent, face charges including conspiring to commit murder or kidnapping outside the U.S. and providing material support and resources resulting in death, the U.S. Justice Department said.

            Sanon is charged with conspiring to smuggle goods from the U.S. and providing unlawful export information. Court documents state that he allegedly shipped 20 ballistic vests to Haiti, but that the items shipped were described as “medical X-ray vests and school supplies.”

            It was not immediately known if the four suspects had attorneys who could comment on the development. The men are scheduled to appear in federal court Wednesday in Miami.

            A total of seven suspects in the case are now in U.S. custody. Dozens of others still languish in Haiti’s main penitentiary, which is severely overcrowded and often lacks food and water for inmates.

            The case has reached a virtual standstill in Haiti, with local officials last year nominating a fifth judge to investigate the killing after four others were dismissed or resigned for personal reasons. 

            One judge told The Associated Press that his family asked him not to take the case because they feared for his life. Another judge stepped down after one of his assistants died under murky circumstances.

            Court documents state that exactly two months before Moïse was killed, Vincent texted Solages a video of a cat “reacting alertly” to the sound of gunfire and that Solages laughed, prompting Vincent to respond: “That’s the way Jovenel will be pretty much, but (sooner) if you guys really up to it!” 

            The document states that Solages responded that “(this) cat will never come back,” and “trust me brother, we definitely working our final decision.”

            Then in June, some 20 former Colombian soldiers were recruited to supposedly help arrest the president and protect Sanon, who envisioned himself as Haiti's new leader. Rivera was in charge of that group, the documents state.

            The plan was to detain Moïse and whisk him to an unidentified location by plane, but that plot fell through when the suspects couldn't find a plane or sufficient weapons, authorities said.

            A day before the killing, Solages falsely told other suspects that it was a CIA operation and that the mission was to kill the president, according to the documents. Shortly before the killing, authorities said, Solages shouted that it was allegedly a DEA operation to ensure compliance from the president’s security detail.

            About a year after the killing, U.S. authorities say they interviewed Solages, Vincent and Rivera while they were in Haitian custody and that they agreed to talk.

            The other suspects already in U.S. custody are Rodolphe Jaar, a former U.S. government informant and a Haitian businessman who was extradited from the Dominican Republic, where he was detained in January 2022.

            That same month, U.S. authorities arrested Mario Antonio Palacios Palacios, a former Colombian soldier who was deported by Jamaica after fleeing there from Haiti. While en route to Colombia, he was detained by U.S. officials in Panama during a layover.

            Also in January 2022, authorities arrested former Haitian Sen. John Joël Joseph, who also had fled to Jamaica.

            Alfredo Izaguirre, a Miami-based lawyer for Palacios, said Tuesday's arrival of the four other suspects will postpone the trial because they all have to be tried at the same time. He said Palacios had been prepared for the trial to begin in early March, but now it could be postponed for up to four months.

            Haiti police say other high-profile suspects remain at large, including a former Supreme Court judge who authorities say was favored to seize power from Moïse instead of Sanon as originally planned. Another fugitive is Joseph Badio, alleged leader of the plot who previously worked for Haiti’s Ministry of Justice and the government’s anti-corruption unit until he was fired, police say.

            Emmanuel Jeanty, an attorney for the president’s widow, Martine Moïse, who was injured in the attack and flown to the U.S. for care, did not return a message for comment.

            In December, Martine Moïse tweeted that her husband — who also has been accused of corruption, which he denied — had fought against it, which resulted in his assassination. ""Despite the blockages, 17 months later, the people are demanding #Justice,” she wrote.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796625,"After academy review, Riseborough will keep Oscar nomination","NEW YORK (AP) — After a review of the awards campaign for the indie drama “To Leslie,"" the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences said Tuesday that Andrea Riseborough will not be stripped of her Oscar nomination for best actress.

            
                The star-studded grassroots campaign for Riseborough had prompted skepticism from some academy voters and caused a stir in Hollywood. On Friday, the academy announced that it would examine whether any rules were broken. Shortly ahead of nominations, Riseborough was propelled into the race after a host of celebrities hosted screenings of “To Leslie” and numerous A-listers promoted her on social media. 

            After appeals from “To Leslie” director Michael Morris and his wife, actor Mary McCormack, Kate Winslet, Charlize Theron, Jennifer Aniston, Gwyneth Paltrow, Amy Adams and Courteney Cox all hosted screenings of the film. Riseborough, a well-regarded British actor, was unexpectedly catapulted into the best-actress race despite the very small audience for “To Leslie"" (about $27,000 in box office). 











            “The Academy has determined the activity in question does not rise to the level that the film’s nomination should be rescinded,” Bill Kramer, academy chief executive, said in a statement. “However, we did discover social media and outreach campaigning tactics that caused concern. These tactics are being addressed with the responsible parties directly.”

            The academy has rescinded nominations for campaigning that broke regulations before. Celebrity-hosted screenings are a regular feature of Oscar season, but how voters are contacted during the Oscar voting period is regulated. On Tuesday, the academy suggested Riseborough's unorthodox campaign may necessitate tweaks to the bylaws. 

            “Given this review, it is apparent that components of the regulations must be clarified to help create a better framework for respectful, inclusive, and unbiased campaigning,” said Kramer. “These changes will be made after this awards cycle and will be shared with our membership. The academy strives to create an environment where votes are based solely on the artistic and technical merits of the eligible films and achievements.”

            Critics of Riseborough’s campaign said it showed how a deep Rolodex could give a potential nominee a leg up. Notably left out of best actress contention were Viola Davis (“Woman King”) and Danielle Deadwyler (“Till”).

            Along with Riseborough, the nominees are: Cate Blachett (“Tár”), Michelle Williams (“The Fabelmans”), Ana de Armas (“Blonde”) and Michelle Yeoh (“Everything Everywhere All at Once”).NEW YORK (AP) — After a review of the awards campaign for the indie drama “To Leslie,"" the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences said Tuesday that Andrea Riseborough will not be stripped of her Oscar nomination for best actress.The star-studded grassroots campaign for Riseborough had prompted skepticism from some academy voters and caused a stir in Hollywood.

Shortly ahead of nominations, Riseborough was propelled into the race after a host of celebrities hosted screenings of “To Leslie” and numerous A-listers promoted her on social media.After appeals from “To Leslie” director Michael Morris and his wife, actor Mary McCormack, Kate Winslet, Charlize Theron, Jennifer Aniston, Gwyneth Paltrow, Amy Adams and Courteney Cox all hosted screenings of the film. Riseborough, a well-regarded British actor, was unexpectedly catapulted into the best-actress race despite the very small audience for “To Leslie"" (about $27,000 in box office).“The Academy has determined the activity in question does not rise to the level that the film’s nomination should be rescinded,” Bill Kramer, academy chief executive, said in a statement. “However, we did discover social media and outreach campaigning tactics that caused concern. These tactics are being addressed with the responsible parties directly.”The academy has rescinded nominations for campaigning that broke regulations before. Celebrity-hosted screenings are a regular feature of Oscar season, but how voters are contacted during the Oscar voting period is regulated. On Tuesday, the academy suggested Riseborough's unorthodox campaign may necessitate tweaks to the bylaws.“Given this review, it is apparent that components of the regulations must be clarified to help create a better framework for respectful, inclusive, and unbiased campaigning,” said Kramer. “These changes will be made after this awards cycle and will be shared with our membership. The academy strives to create an environment where votes are based solely on the artistic and technical merits of the eligible films and achievements.”Critics of Riseborough’s campaign said it showed how a deep Rolodex could give a potential nominee a leg up. Notably left out of best actress contention were Viola Davis (“Woman King”) and Danielle Deadwyler (“Till”).Along with Riseborough, the nominees are: Cate Blachett (“Tár”), Michelle Williams (“The Fabelmans”), Ana de Armas (“Blonde”) and Michelle Yeoh (“Everything Everywhere All at Once”).",2023/02/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796626,Falcons hire Gray from Packers as assistant head coach for D,"FLOWERY BRANCH, Ga. (AP) — Atlanta Falcons coach Arthur Smith continued to reshape his defensive staff by hiring Jerry Gray as the assistant head coach for defense on Tuesday.

            Gray, 60, brings 26 years of NFL coaching experience to Atlanta, including eight as a defensive coordinator and 16 as a defensive backs coach. In those 24 years as a coordinator or defensive backs coach, his defenses have ranked in the top 10 in scoring defense 10 times and in passing defense 13 times.

            The addition of Gray, who had been Green Bay’s defensive backs coach and passing game coordinator, forms a reunion with Smith. 











            The two worked together as assistants on Washington’s staff in 2007-08 and on Tennessee’s staff from 2011-13, when Gray was the Titans defensive coordinator.

            Gray also is a former defensive coordinator with Buffalo (2001-05).

            The hiring of Gray comes after the Falcons hired Ryan Nielsen as defensive coordinator on Friday. Nielsen had been the New Orleans Saints co-defensive coordinator.

            When hiring Nielsen, the Falcons announced three defensive assistants will not return next season: defensive line coach Gary Emanuel, outside linebackers coach Ted Monachino and secondary coach Jon Hoke.

            The Packers finished in the top 10 in passing defense in each of Gray’s three seasons on the staff. The Packers ranked sixth in passing defense in 2022.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796627,Monarch butterflies wintering in California rebound,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — The population of western monarch butterflies wintering along the California coast has rebounded for a second year in a row after a precipitous drop in 2020, but the population of orange-and-black insects is still well below what it used to be, researchers announced Tuesday.

            Volunteers who visited sites in California and Arizona around Thanksgiving tallied more than 330,000 butterflies, the highest number of these insects counted in the last six years. It was a promising rebound after the annual winter count in 2020 recorded fewer than 2,000 butterflies. In 2021, the number recorded was 247,000. 

            “I think we can all celebrate and this is really exciting,” said Emma Pelton, a conservation biologist at the Xerces Society, a nonprofit environmental organization that focuses on the conservation of invertebrates. “We were all so relieved last year when we had about 250,000 butterflies, and to see that number tick up even modestly this year it's really a good sign that we've got a second chance.”











            Pelton said it’s not clear why the population has rebounded but one explanation could be that eastern monarch butterflies, which tend to spend the winter in Mexico, could be mixing with their western counterparts.

            “Some of that kind of leakage could be occurring and I don’t think we fully understand the system enough to say what it is,"" she said. “But I think one thing it’s not is that all is well or that we all made human actions that magically made it all better.”

            The population is still far below what it was in the 1980s, when monarchs numbered in the millions.

            Scientists say the butterflies are at critically low levels in western states because of destruction to their milkweed habitat along their migratory route as housing expands into their territory and use of pesticides and herbicides increases.

            Along with farming, climate change is one of the main drivers of the monarch’s threatened extinction, disrupting an annual 3,000-mile (4,828-kilometer) migration synched to springtime and the blossoming of wildflowers. 

            Western monarch butterflies head south from the Pacific Northwest to California each winter, returning to the same places and even the same trees, where they cluster to keep warm. The monarchs breed multiple generations along the way for thousands of miles before reaching California where they generally arrive at the beginning of November. Once warmer weather arrives in March, they spread east of California.

            On the eastern side of the Rocky Mountains, another monarch population travels from southern Canada and the northeastern United States across thousands of miles to spend the winter in central Mexico. Scientists estimate the monarch population in the eastern U.S. has fallen about 80% since the mid-1990s, but the drop-off in the western U.S. has been even steeper. 

            Adult monarch butterflies live for a few weeks, whereas monarchs that spend the winter clustered in trees and emerge in late summer and early fall can live up to nine months. When temperatures warm up, they fly back to their breeding grounds where their reproduction cycle starts anew. 

            The western monarch count is conducted by trained volunteers over several weeks around the Thanksgiving holiday. It dates back to 1997 and has observed a loss of more than 95% of a population that according to earlier studies once numbered in the low millions.

            This year the insects' wintering habitat along California's central coast was also battered by heavy rains and volunteers reported more monarchs blown from their clusters and vulnerable to the cold, wet conditions and predation, the Xerces Society said in a statement. 

            The group normally also conducts a second count after the New Year. This year's results will be announced in February and shed light on how much winter storms impacted the butterflies, said Isis Howard, an endangered species conservation biologist with the Xerces Society.

            Howard said the follow-up New Year’s counts usually show a 30% to 50% decline in butterflies from the Thanksgiving count.

            “Because the storms were so intense and so back-to-back this year, it seems reasonable to assume that there might be increased mortality this winter, leading to a smaller population that’ll kick off the breeding season this next spring and summer,"" she said.SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — The population of western monarch butterflies wintering along the California coast has rebounded for a second year in a row after a precipitous drop in 2020, but the population of orange-and-black insects is still well below what it used to be, researchers announced Tuesday.Volunteers who visited sites in California and Arizona around Thanksgiving tallied more than 330,000 butterflies, the highest number of these insects counted in the last six years.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796628,Michigan State player who swung helmet gets probation,"ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) — A Michigan State football player who swung his helmet at a Michigan player in a stadium tunnel expressed regret Tuesday and said he's “just looking forward to wuppin' some maize and blue” on the field.

            Khary Crump, a defensive back, was sentenced to probation. He was one of seven Michigan State players charged in a skirmish that followed a loss at Michigan Stadium on Oct. 29.

            Crump was the only Spartan facing a felony, but that charge was dismissed in an agreement to plead guilty to misdemeanors. His record will be scrubbed clean if he stays out of trouble while on probation.











            “Unfortunately, an exchange of words (took place), I felt attacked and unfortunately I did what I did,” Crump said of the tunnel altercation involving Michigan's Gemon Green. “I’m not proud of that. I’m looking forward to moving forward.”

            Crump was suspended by coach Mel Tucker. In addition, the Big Ten has suspended him for eight games in 2023.

            “I had difficulties trying to stomach my actions ... on that fateful day, but it happened. I can’t take it back,” Crump told MLive.com after the court hearing. “Honestly, I’m just looking forward to wuppin' some maize and blue in the future — on the football field, of course.”

            At least four other players charged with misdemeanors will likely have their cases dismissed in exchange for community service and other conditions. The cases against two others are pending.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796629,Sweden PM says 'foreign actors' exploiting protests,"STOCKHOLM (AP) — Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson on Tuesday denounced activists who burned the Quran and hanged an effigy of Turkey’s president in Stockholm as “useful idiots” for foreign powers who want to inflict harm on the Scandinavian country as it seeks to join NATO.

            “We have seen how foreign actors, even state actors, have used these manifestations to inflame the situation in a way that is directly harmful to Swedish security,” Kristersson told reporters in Stockholm, without naming any countries.

            The prime minister gathered leaders of Sweden’s parliamentary parties to discuss the national security situation amid rising tensions with Turkey and a wave of anti-Swedish protests in other Muslim countries. 











            The protests came in reaction to a series of small demonstrations this month in Stockholm targeting Turkey and its president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

            In one protest, an effigy of Erdogan was hanged on a lamp post outside Stockholm’s City Hall. In another, a far-right activist burned a Quran outside the Turkish Embassy.

            Ankara reacted furiously to the protests and warned that Sweden could not expect its support in joining NATO.

            Swedish government officials have distanced themselves from the protests while stressing that they are protected by freedom of speech.

            “The groups and individuals who carried out this kind of action, in this security situation, they become useful idiots for forces that wish harm upon Sweden,” Kristersson said.

            He said tht his center-right government is working through diplomatic channels to cool down the situation and that he had spoken by phone with U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796630,Elon Musk's Tesla tweet trial delves into investor damages,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — An Elon Musk tweet declaring he had the financing to take Tesla private in 2018 caused billions of dollars in investor damages after the deal collapsed, according to estimates presented Tuesday at a trial examining the haphazard handling of the buyout proposal.

            The mind-bending estimates laid out by two experts hired by attorneys representing Tesla shareholders underscored the challenges facing a nine-person jury as the three-week trial winds down this week. U.S. District Judge Edward Chen expects to turn the case over to the jury Friday. 

            Depending on the verdict, Musk and the electric automaker that he runs could be facing more financial fallout for his unpredictable behavior on the Twitter platform, which he now owns. Without acknowledging any wrongdoing, Musk and Tesla reached a $40 million settlement with securities regulators after Musk's troublesome tweets in August 2018.











            In this class-action lawsuit on behalf of Tesla shareholders, the jurors must first determine whether two tweets that Musk abruptly posted on Aug. 7, 2018 steered Tesla investors in the wrong direction. If the jury decides to hold Musk accountable for the tweets that Chen has already deemed falsehood s, they will will face what may be an even more formidable task — trying to calculate how much Musk — one of the world's richest people — and Tesla should have to pay for the misleading tweets.

            One of Tuesday's two experts, economist Michael Hartzmark, reviewed a report peppered with terms such as “but-for"" and “consequential inflation"" that made a case for calculating the damages suffered by Tesla shareholders during a 10-day period in August 2018 at anywhere from $4 billion to $11 billion, or $22.55 to $66.67 per Tesla share at that time. 

            Another expert, University of Maryland finance professor Steven Heston, reviewed an even denser report analyzing the impact of Musk's tweets on more than 2,000 types of Tesla stock options, drawing largely upon a formula known as the Black-Scholes model widely used by companies to value executive compensation packages.

            When pressed by a Musk lawyer about the reliability of his model, Heston acknowledged: “All models deviate from reality, which is why they are models.""

            Heston, who said he was paid $300,000 to $350,000 for his work in the case, demurred on trying to make a concrete estimate on the investor damages, saying that was a job for the jurors.

            The crux of the case hinges on an Aug. 7, 2018, tweet in which Musk declared “funding secured ” to take Tesla private. Musk abruptly posted the tweet minutes before boarding his private jet after being alerted that the Financial Times was about to publish a story that Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund had spent about $2 billion buying a 5% stake in Tesla to diversify its interests beyond oil, according to his testimony.

            Amid widespread confusion about whether Musk’s Twitter account had been hacked or he was joking, Musk followed up a few hours later with another tweet suggesting a deal was imminent.

            During roughly eight hours of sworn testimony, Musk repeatedly insisted he was looking after shareholders' best interests and believed he had a financing commitment from the Saudi fund that was recanted after his “funding secured"" tweet. Musk also testified he could have still pulled off the buyout by raising money from other investors and selling some of his stock in SpaceX, a rocket ship maker that he founded. 

            After consulting with Tesla's major shareholders, Musk decided the electric automaker should remain publicly traded — a decision that has paid off for him and other investors. Tesla's shares are now worth more than eight times what they were at the time of Musk's buyout tweet, after adjusting for two stock splits that have occurred since then.SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — An Elon Musk tweet declaring he had the financing to take Tesla private in 2018 caused billions of dollars in investor damages after the deal collapsed, according to estimates presented Tuesday at a trial examining the haphazard handling of the buyout proposal.The mind-bending estimates laid out by two experts hired by attorneys representing Tesla shareholders underscored the challenges facing a nine-person jury as the three-week trial winds down this week.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796633,Appeals court upholds restraining order on Illinois gun ban,"SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) — An Illinois appellate court on Tuesday upheld a temporary restraining order on enforcement of the state's three-week-old law banning semiautomatic weapons, enacted largely in response to the mass shooting at an Independence Day parade in the Chicago suburb of Highland Park.

            A three-judge panel for the 5th District Appellate Court affirmed the restraining order issued Jan. 20 by a circuit judge in Effingham County. 

            Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul, a Democrat, plans to appeal the ruling to the state Supreme Court.











            The Protect Illinois Communities Act prohibits the manufacture or possession of semiautomatic handguns and rifles. Those who owned them before the Jan. 10 effective date of the law must register them with the Illinois State Police by Jan. 1, 2024.

            Hundreds of gun owners, merchants and advocates filed suit in Effingham, about 10 miles (160 kilometers) northeast of St. Louis, seeking the restraining order. They argued that the Legislature improperly enacted the law and that by exempting some classes of people — law enforcement, corrections officers, retired police officials — denied potentially millions of other gun owners equal protection under the law. 

            Plaintiffs' attorney Thomas DeVore, a Republican who ran unsuccessfully last fall for state attorney general, said the equal protection argument under the Constitution's 14th Amendment was persuasive in upholding the restraining order. 

            The law became a priority for Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Democrats who control the General Assembly after the Highland Park shooting, which left seven dead and injured 30. 

            Illinois is the eighth state, along with Washington, D.C., to restrict such guns.

            The attorney general's office said it would seek an expedited schedule of proceedings from the state's high court.

            “The Protect Illinois Communities Act is an important tool in what must be a comprehensive approach to addressing gun violence throughout Illinois, and we remain committed to defending the statute’s constitutionality,” spokesperson Annie Thompson said in a statement. 

            DeVore said the restraining order applies only to the plaintiffs, which include gun dealers that may continue selling the weapons, and that it must be followed by all circuit courts in the state, even outside the 5th District, unless an appellate court elsewhere holds differently.

Pritzker and Democrats who control the General Assembly after the Highland Park shooting, which left seven dead and injured 30.Illinois is the eighth state, along with Washington, D.C., to restrict such guns.The attorney general's office said it would seek an expedited schedule of proceedings from the state's high court.“The Protect Illinois Communities Act is an important tool in what must be a comprehensive approach to addressing gun violence throughout Illinois, and we remain committed to defending the statute’s constitutionality,” spokesperson Annie Thompson said in a statement.DeVore said the restraining order applies only to the plaintiffs, which include gun dealers that may continue selling the weapons, and that it must be followed by all circuit courts in the state, even outside the 5th District, unless an appellate court elsewhere holds differently.___Follow Political Writer John O’Connor at https://twitter.com/apoconnor",2023/02/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796634,"Despite 'Cop City' protests, Atlanta moves forward with plan","ATLANTA (AP) — In the wake of the shooting death of an environmental activist, Atlanta-area officials reiterated Tuesday that they are moving forward with plans to construct a huge police and firefighter training center that protesters derisively refer to as “Cop City.”

            Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens held a news conference to announce that the city had signed a memorandum of understanding with DeKalb County to build the $90 million Atlanta Public Safety Training Center. He also said officials have pledged to enact certain environmental protections after consulting with a “community advisory committee.”

            It was one of officials' most full-throated defenses of a plan that has faced consistent pushback from both locals and out-of-state leftist activists, some of whom moved into the South River Forest over a year ago and built platforms in surrounding trees. Self-described “forest defenders” say the project involves cutting down so many trees that it would be environmentally damaging. They also oppose investing so much money in a project which they say will be used to practice “urban warfare.”











            Dickens emphasized that the facilities will be built on a site that was cleared decades ago for a former state prison farm. He said the tract is filled with rubble and overgrown with invasive species, not hardwood trees. The mayor also said that while the facility will be built on an 85-acre site, about 300 other acres would be preserved as a public greenspace.

            ""This is Atlanta, and we know forests. This facility would not be built over a forest,” Dickens said. 

            Outside City Hall, a few dozen protesters gathered to oppose the project, chanting, “We don't want your compromise! Stop Cop City!” 

            The news conference came nearly two weeks after the death of an activist known as Tortuguita, who was killed by authorities after officials said the 26-year-old shot a state trooper. Authorities said they fired in self-defense, but protesters have said they do not believe the police narrative, noting the lack of body camera footage from the Jan. 18 shooting.

            The fatal shooting of Tortuguita, whose given name was Manuel Esteban Paez Terán, prompted a large Jan. 21 demonstration in downtown Atlanta that erupted into violence as a masked contingent lit a police cruiser on fire, threw rocks and launched fireworks at a skyscraper that houses the Atlanta Police Foundation, shattering windows. No injuries were reported, but six people were arrested that night and charged with domestic terrorism.

            Atlanta Police Chief Darin Schierbaum and Fire Chief Roderick Smith argued in favor of the project Tuesday, saying it would replace substandard offerings and boost morale, especially as the police department has struggled with hiring and retention.

            In addition to classrooms and administration buildings, the training center would include a shooting range, a driving course to practice chases and a “burn building” for firefighters to work on putting out fires. A “mock village” featuring a fake home, convenience store and nightclub would also be built for authorities to rehearse raids. 

            Officials on Tuesday did not say when they expect construction to begin, but Schierbaum said he does not believe there are currently any activists still camping out at the site.

            The training center was approved by the City Council in 2021 after 17 hours of public comments — the majority of which were in opposition to the project. Some locals cited noise concerns, while others said the planned destruction of nature significantly undermines the city’s efforts to preserve its famed tree canopy and would exacerbate local flooding risks.

            Many activists also oppose spending so much money on a police facility that would be surrounded by poor, majority-Black neighborhoods in a city with one of the nation’s highest degrees of wealth inequality.

            Immediately after the news conference was over, DeKalb County Commissioner Ted Terry began seeking out reporters to push back on local officials' claims that the planning process has been transparent and open to community engagement.

            “I learned about this press conference today,” said Terry. “I represent this area of DeKalb County and there's still a lot of outstanding questions that haven't been addressed. I think we're off to a bad start because transparency and accountability mean everyone should be at the table, and that's not taking place right now.""ATLANTA (AP) — In the wake of the shooting death of an environmental activist, Atlanta-area officials reiterated Tuesday that they are moving forward with plans to construct a huge police and firefighter training center that protesters derisively refer to as “Cop City.”Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens held a news conference to announce that the city had signed a memorandum of understanding with DeKalb County to build the $90 million Atlanta Public Safety Training Center.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796636,Andy Reid turned a 6-inch binder into a Hall of Fame resume,"Andy Reid was an unknown assistant in Green Bay when Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie took a chance on hiring Brett Favre’s position coach to revive a struggling franchise in Philadelphia.

            A newspaper headline greeted Reid’s arrival with a headline that said: “Andy Who?”

            Everybody knows his name now.











            Reid won more games (130) than any coach in franchise history during his 14 seasons with the Eagles. He led Philadelphia to nine playoff appearances, six division titles and five NFC championship games. But Reid couldn’t deliver a Super Bowl victory, losing to the New England Patriots after the 2004 season. For that reason, he was underappreciated by many fans and reporters in Philly.

            Reid eventually lost his job after only his third losing season in 2012, and immediately landed in Kansas City. He finally hoisted that elusive Vince Lombardi Trophy with Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs three years ago.

            By that time, the Eagles had won their first Super Bowl under then-coach Doug Pederson, one of Reid’s prized pupils.

            Now, Reid and the Eagles are going head-to-head aiming for that second title. The Chiefs (16-3) vs. the Eagles (16-3) is one of the most-anticipated Super Bowl matchups in recent years.

            Just don’t expect the stoic Reid to get emotional about it.

            “When you really cut to the chase on it, they’re a really good football team and so, I think that’s where the energy goes because really when it’s kickoff, you’re playing that team,” Reid said Monday. 

            “It’s the players that you’re going against and the coaches and so the uniform (and) all, that’s not where your mind’s at. Your mind’s at making sure you have a solid game plan and that you come out and you can perform to the best of our ability.

            “That’s, I think, where the major focus goes, and you try to — it doesn’t matter who you’re playing — you try to blank out all the hype that goes with the game. It’s a pretty big game for everybody. ... It’s a big, big deal. It’s the Super Bowl. But you try to blank that out and make sure that you’re getting the game plan — what really matters — together.”

            Nearly a quarter century since he walked into an interview with the Eagles armed with a 6-inch binder containing notes on how to build a winning team, Reid has amassed Hall of Fame credentials. He’s led the Chiefs to nine playoff appearances, including seven consecutive division titles in 10 winning seasons. He’s been to five straight AFC title games, winning three.

            “It’s a real testament to the job that general manager Brett Veach and Coach Reid have done over the last several years,” Chiefs chairman Clark Hunt said after the team clinched the division last month. 

            “We obviously have a bunch of young players and we’ve got some new players, and Andy and his staff have done a tremendous job of incorporating them into the team. That’s just part of the National Football League. They’ve really done a fantastic job, and I couldn’t be more proud of them.”

            Reid is a no-nonsense, old-school coach who is respected and loved by his players. He rarely throws anyone under the bus. Part of the criticism he received from reporters in Philly was for his unwillingness to call anyone out and to always shoulder all the blame after losses and poor performances. “I gotta do a better job” became a punch line.

            He came across as robotic in news conferences, always opening with injuries before turning it over to reporters for questions by saying: “Time’s yours.”

            At 64, Reid has become more of a lovable grandpa in Kansas City. He’s known for wearing floral shirts and cracking jokes about his weight. Ask Reid how he plans to celebrate a victory and he’ll say with a cheeseburger.

            “I’m gonna go get the biggest cheeseburger you’ve ever seen!” Reid said after the Chiefs beat the 49ers in the Super Bowl on Feb. 2, 2020.

            After a victory over the Seahawks on Dec. 24, Mahomes and All-Pro tight end Travis Kelce presented Reid with a cheeseburger inside a wrapped Nike shoe box as a Christmas gift. 

            Players in the locker room cheered and hollered.

            Reid smiled and shouted: “May you all get a gift as great as this.”

            Another Lombardi trophy would be the best present of all.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796637,Batting title put McNeil in driver's seat for $50M deal,"NEW YORK (AP) — Winning a batting title put Jeff McNeil in the driver's seat — for a big-money contract and a new car.

            New York Mets teammate Francisco Lindor told McNeil early last season he would gift him a vehicle if McNeil won a batting championship. The second baseman led the major leagues at .326, and the Mets rewarded him Tuesday with a $50 million, four-year deal.

            “I did send Lindor a pretty good video of some very nice cars the other day,"" McNeil said during a Citi Field news conference. ""So any one of those should be up to my standards.”











            McNeil was coy about the make and model other than to say “they were one brand of a very nice ...” before cutting himself off.

            Lindor's reply?

            “He said those were nice cars,” McNeil recalled. “We'll see what happens in spring training.”

            A 12th-round pick in the 2013 amateur draft, McNeil was at Double-A Binghamton as a 26-year-old in 2018.

            “Wondering if you’re going to get paid,” he said.

            He was promoted to Triple-A Las Vegas that June and made his big league debut that July 24 with a first-pitch, pinch-hit single against San Diego's Phil Hughes. McNeil earned $202,177 in the majors that year, $567,714 in 2019, $228,769 for the pandemic-shortened 2020 season and $642,251 in 2021 before a raise to $3 million last year in his first season of arbitration eligibility.

            “You never know what’s going to happen. You're one injury away from being out of this game. And that’s frustrating, that's scary sometimes,"" the two-time All-Star said. ""But this deal is able to kind of take that off my mind, and I'm just going to go out there and play hard and be the baseball player I know I am.”

            His wife Tatiana and son Lucas, born last July 13, watched from the first row.

            “My wife puts him in front of the TV. He’s got no clue,” McNeil said. “But when mom starts cheering, he gets pretty excited as well.”

            McNeil's contract calls for a $6.25 million salary this year, $10.25 million in 2024 and $15.75 million in each of the following two seasons. The Mets have a $15.75 million option for 2027 with a $2 million buyout, a season that if exercised would make the agreement worth $63.75 million over five years.

            “When you are able to bring players through your system up to the big leagues, the connectivity that you feel in the organization and the morale that it kind of inspires is a really strong feeling for everybody,” Mets general manager Billy Eppler said. “Jeff had the talent, the resolve to scratch, claw, fight through a lot of adversity and to make it to this point, and this is a very well-deserved day for him.”

            McNeil's worth to the Mets has increased in the inverse to his uniform number, which dropped from 68 as a rookie to 6 in 2019 and to 1 last year. Primarily a second baseman the past two seasons, he also plays the corner outfield spots on occasion.

            New York has boosted its projected luxury tax payroll to around $390 million heading into its third season under owner Steve Cohen, which would leave the team with a tax bill of about $116 million. The Mets added pitchers Justin Verlander, Kodai Senga, José Quintana and David Robertson this offseason, along with catcher Omar Narváez and outfielder Tommy Pham. They also re-signed outfielder Brandon Nimmo for $162 million over eight years and closer Edwin Díaz for $102 million over five years.

            McNeil could have become a free agent after the 2024 season.

            “It starts with ownership. They want to put a winner on the field and it’s been pretty amazing to see what the Mets look like the last few years,” he said. “I want to be a part of that.”

            Eppler sidestepped questions about a possible long-term deal for slugging first baseman Pete Alonso, who has a $14.5 million, one-year contract and can go free after the 2024 World Series.

            “I really don’t want to have kind of our business out on the street,” Eppler said. “I don’t think it’s fair to the people involved.”

Through this initiative, SAP will provide strategic support to eligible partners, which may include coordinated industry-aligned solutions, joint go-to-market strategy, and access to SAP regional and market unit industry expertise.   The RSSP initiative will enable partners to scale their SAP practice more quickly across the APJ region and collaborate more closely with SAP to deliver joint customer success. Distinct from the company's existing  Global Strategic Services Partner (GSSP) program that includes a select group of SAP's most strategic global partners in the consulting, infrastructure, and technology space, the RSSP initiative aims to facilitate collaboration within partner entities residing in the region that demonstrate capability and capacity requirements specific to APJ.   To qualify for the RSSP initiative, candidate partners are required to meet or exceed a defined set of SAP criteria including geographical presence, vertical industry competencies, and alignment on a joint sustainability strategy.   SAP also announced  ABeam Consulting, a Japan-headquartered integrated management consulting firm, as its first partner on board the RSSP initiative.   ""APJ is one of the fastest-growing regions for SAP, and our partner ecosystem plays an integral role in customers' transformation. With over 24,000 registered partners globally and close to 20% in APJ, there is a large SAP-certified community that can benefit customers and the broader ecosystem,"" said  Paul Marriott, President APJ, SAP. ""Congratulations to ABeam Consulting on becoming our first partner to join the Regional Strategic Services Partner initiative. We look forward to amplifying ABeam's SAP expertise across the region and drive more innovations for customers. And I look forward to welcoming more regional partners to the RSSP initiative.""   ""It gives us great pride to know that ABeam Consulting is the first partner on board SAP's Regional Strategic Services Partner initiative. This is a recognition of the fast growth of SAP business in Asia Pacific and the quality of our flexible and adaptive services that take into account diverse local business practices and needs. It also highlights our advantages in delivering cutting-edge solutions and realising customer value, as well as the scalability of our integrated deployment across our Asian offices. This initiative further strengthens our partnership with SAP while driving the ABeam Consulting growth strategy aimed at making us the No. 1 consulting firm in Asia as a social change accelerator,"" said  Tatsuya Kamoi, President and CEO, ABeam Consulting.

By raising worldwide awareness, improving education and catalysing personal, collective and government action, UICC partners across the world with many corporate businesses and individuals to reimagine a world where millions of preventable cancer deaths are saved and access to life-saving cancer treatment and care is equitable for all - no matter who you are or where you live.   Created in 2000, World Cancer Day has grown into a positive movement for everyone, everywhere to unite under one voice to face one of the greatest challenges in history.   Each year, hundreds of activities and events take place around the world, gathering communities, organisations and individuals in schools, businesses, hospitals, marketplaces, parks, community halls, places of worship - in the streets and online - acting as a powerful reminder that we all have a role to play in reducing the global impact of cancer.   While we live in a time of awe-inspiring advancements in cancer prevention, diagnosis and treatment, many of us who seek cancer care hit barriers at every turn. Income, education, geographical location and discrimination based on ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, age, disability and lifestyle are just a few of the factors that can negatively affect care.   Throughout the month of February,  Hugill & Ip runs the  Double Your Impact campaign in support of the  Asian Fund for Cancer Research (AFCR). The firm will be matching direct donations to AFCR received this month, as well as raise funds from other corporate entities and individuals. The firm will also offer a free Estate Planning service for minimum donations of HK$3,800 that donors will directly give to the organisation.   Hugill & Ip also customizes its logo throughout the duration of the campaign to raise awareness of cancer and to encourage its prevention, detection and treatment. Moreover, it continues to increase awareness about legal issues related to individuals affected by cancer.   The Asian Cancer Research Foundation (AFCR) is dedicated to funding cancer research and promoting global collaborations to save the lives of cancer patients, with a focus on cancers prevalent in Asian populations. As a proud member of the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) and in support of the #ClosetheCareGap movement, AFCR continues to fund innovative solutions to eliminate unequal access to cancer care and treatment in the region. AFCR is committed to making a high impact in the fight against cancer and continues to support ground-breaking research that benefits people affected by the disease.   Lance Kawaguchi – Chairman of AFCR and CEO of  Cure Brain Cancer Foundation – commented: ""On World Cancer Day, we're honoring the people who fight cancer every day - from pioneering researchers and dedicated doctors to courageous patients. We believe that cancer can be cured and that through partnerships and collaboration, we can fund research and support early-stage oncology companies to work toward a cure. Together, we can make a difference.""   Hugill & Ip is proud to support AFCR, including through the provision of pro-bono legal services to the cancer research support organization and sponsorship of its BRACE Award Program. The AFCR's BRACE Award Program aims to provide vital funding to early-stage biotechnology, enabling them to accelerate their innovative therapeutics, diagnostics and cancer prevention products into the clinic, with the ultimate goal of improving outcomes for patients affected by cancer globally.   Adam Hugill – Managing Partner of Hugill & Ip – observed: ""Giving back to the community is part of our firm's ethos and we are thrilled to continue extending our pro-bono support to AFCR. We have worked with the organization since Hugill & Ip's early days.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796655,Widow's suit: Unarmed mentally ill husband shot in back,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — A California widow whose husband was suffering from a mental health crisis when she called a nonemergency number for help last year sued Culver City police Tuesday, alleging they shot her unarmed husband in the back as he was running from officers.

            Adriana Medina filed her civil rights and wrongful death lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the fatal shooting of Guillermo Medina on Dec. 18 in the Los Angeles suburb.

            Medina was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia and hadn't taken his medication in a couple of weeks when he showed up at his home and pounded on the windows, his wife said at a news conference. 











            She purposely avoided calling 911 and dialed the main number of the police station in hopes of having a mental health intervention. She told police she did not believe her husband was going to hurt anyone, according to the lawsuit.

            “That cry for help became a death sentence,” attorney V. James DeSimone said.

            A police spokesperson would not comment on pending litigation but a press release issued after the shooting said officers responded to a domestic violence call involving a husband threatening his wife with a handgun. 

            “There was no report of domestic violence,” DeSimone said. “There was no report that he was threatening her with a handgun. She never saw a gun.”

            The conflicting statements from both police and Medina’s wife, along with grainy video of the shooting, make it too difficult to determine if the shooting was justified, said Ed Obayashi, a deputy sheriff and adviser to the Plumas County sheriff who investigates use of force incidents for police in California and nationwide.

            Recordings of the call to police and what dispatchers relayed to officers will be crucial in determining the threat they may have perceived, he said.

            “The most important factor is whether there was an immediate threat posed to the officers,"" Obayashi said. “Assuming officers have been advised that there is a gun is a very relevant factor in determining if deadly force is justified.”

            Guillermo Medina fled in a car when police arrived and then ran on foot after crashing into a median, police said in press release.

            DeSimone presented a surveillance video from a building that showed Medina loping up to a utility pole and then dropping to his knees and rolling onto his back. Officers approached slowly and one appeared to handcuff him. 

            It appeared to take several minutes before first aid was rendered.

            The coroner's office determined the cause of death was homicide, DeSimone said.

            The shooting is being investigated by the state attorney general's office. 

            Adriana Medina said her husband was a good father who cooked for their children and coached them in youth soccer.

Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said the bomber was in the first row in the prayer hall when he struck.The attack is the deadliest in Peshawar since twin suicide bombings at All Saints Church killed scores of worshippers in September 2013, in what is the deadliest attack on Pakistan's Christian minority.Peshawar sits on the edge of the Pashtun tribal lands, a region mired in violence for the past two decades. The most active militant group in the area is the Pakistani Taliban, also called Tehreek-e-TalibanPakistan (TTP), an umbrella group for Sunni and sectarian Islamist factions opposed to the government in Islamabad.No group has officially owned the attack, but Sanaullah said a breakaway faction of the TTP called Khurasani had claimed responsibility.The TTP denied responsibility, though it has stepped up attacks since withdrawing from a peace deal with the government last year.The policy to release militants under a amnesty as part of the deal has resulted in the bombing, Sanaullah said, adding that some of the militants who were set free also included some on death row.The bombing took place a day before an IMF mission arrived in Islamabad for talks on a stalled $7 billion bailout.(Reporting by Jibran Ahmad in Peshawar and Asif Shahzad in Islamabad; Editing by Sudipto Ganguly, Miral Fahmy, Simon Cameron-Moore, Nick Macfie, William Maclean)",2023/02/01,212,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796664,"Pell mourned at Sydney cathedral day before funeral, protest","CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — Mourners paid their respects to Cardinal George Pell in a Sydney cathedral Wednesday a day before the funeral and interment of a polarizing church leader who was once the most senior Catholic convicted of sex abuse.

            Pell, who died last month at age 81, spent more than a year in prison before his convictions were overturned in 2020. 

            Once the third-highest-ranking cleric in the Vatican, he returned to Australia in 2017 to fight abuse allegations made by multiple complainants over decades in his home state of Victoria. Only charges that he abused two choirboys in his early months as archbishop of Melbourne in the late 1990s led to convictions. He spent 404 days in mostly solitary confinement before he was cleared. But his Vatican career by then had ended.











            The staunchly conservative church leader will lie in St. Mary’s Cathedral until he is interred at the cathedral crypt after a funeral Mass on Thursday.

            Sydney-based gay rights group Community Action for Rainbow Rights has called for people to join what it calls its “Pell go to Hell!” protest outside the cathedral and expects more than 300 demonstrators to attend.

            Pell had riled gay activists with views including: “Homosexual activity is a much greater health hazard than smoking.”

            The New South Wales Police Force had asked the New South Wales Supreme Court to prohibit the rally. But its application was withdrawn Wednesday after organizers agreed not to march on a street alongside the cathedral. The rally begins across the street from the cathedral at Hyde Park.

            Justice Peter Garling praised both police and protesters for finding a compromise.

            “I would like to thank the parties and the lawyers for resolving something that arouses no doubt great passions,” Garling said before leaving the bench without making a court order.

            Police Acting Assistant Commissioner Martin Fileman described the street between the cathedral and the park as a “buffer zone” that reduced the risk of clashes between protesters and the thousands of mourners.

            “We ask that people attending on both sides tomorrow that they’re respectful of each other. And that they comply with police directions,” Fileman told reporters outside court.

            Protest organizer Kim Stern was satisfied that the demonstrators could be in earshot of the cathedral congregation.

            “We’re now able to march up, right opposite the church and have our voices heard,” Stern told reporters.

            New South Wales Premier Dominic Perrottet urged all sides to behave respectfully. Perrottet, a Catholic, said he will not attend the Mass, but will be represented by a government minister.

            “I would say to everybody across our state today it’s a time to come together and show respect,” Perrottet told reporters.

            Earlier Wednesday, protesters tied ribbons in memory of victims of clergy abuse to the cathedral’s fence.

            Church officials had removed such ribbons in recent days, raising accusations of disrespect toward victims. But a cathedral official told protesters on Wednesday where ribbons could be placed and where they could not.

            Still, protesters persisted in tying ribbons near the gates through which the hearse entered the cathedral grounds, and security guards repeatedly cut them down.

            Pell was archbishop of Sydney from 2001 until 2014 when Pope Francis appointed him to be the first prefect of the newly created Secretariat for the Economy tasked with reforming the Vatican’s notoriously opaque finances.

            Pell had been archbishop of Melbourne from 1996 to 2001, the period during which he was alleged to have sexually abused two choirboys in St. Patrick’s Cathedral. He was convicted then acquitted after a second appeal.

            As church leader of Melbourne and later of Sydney, Pell repeatedly refused to give Communion to gay activists wearing rainbow-colored sashes.

            “God made Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve, and important consequences follow from this,” Pell told a St. Mary’s congregation in 2002 after he first refused Communion to a gay activist in Sydney.

            Pell was also a lightning rod for disagreements over whether the Catholic Church has been properly held to account for past child sex abuse.

            A national inquiry into institutional responses to child sex abuse found in 2017 that Pell knew of clergy molesting children in the 1970s and did not take adequate action to address it.

            Pell later said he was “surprised” by the inquiry's findings. “These views are not supported by evidence,” Pell’s statement said.

            Pell and his supporters believed he was scapegoated for all the crimes of the Australian Catholic Church’s botched response to clergy sexual abuse.

            He died Jan. 10 in Rome from heart complications following hip surgery. Francis imparted a final blessing at Pell’s funeral Mass held at St. Peter’s Basilica on Jan. 14.

            Pell's Pontifical Requiem Mass in Sydney on Thursday will be livestreamed on the cathedral's YouTube channel and televised on large screens on the cathedral's forecourt to accommodate anticipated large numbers of mourners, church officials said.CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — Mourners paid their respects to Cardinal George Pell in a Sydney cathedral Wednesday a day before the funeral and interment of a polarizing church leader who was once the most senior Catholic convicted of sex abuse.Pell, who died last month at age 81, spent more than a year in prison before his convictions were overturned in 2020.Once the third-highest-ranking cleric in the Vatican, he returned to Australia in 2017 to fight abuse allegations made by multiple complainants over decades in his home state of Victoria. Only charges that he abused two choirboys in his early months as archbishop of Melbourne in the late 1990s led to convictions. He spent 404 days in mostly solitary confinement before he was cleared. But his Vatican career by then had ended.The staunchly conservative church leader will lie in St. Mary’s Cathedral until he is interred at the cathedral crypt after a funeral Mass on Thursday.Sydney-based gay rights group Community Action for Rainbow Rights has called for people to join what it calls its “Pell go to Hell!” protest outside the cathedral and expects more than 300 demonstrators to attend.Pell had riled gay activists with views including: “Homosexual activity is a much greater health hazard than smoking.”The New South Wales Police Force had asked the New South Wales Supreme Court to prohibit the rally. But its application was withdrawn Wednesday after organizers agreed not to march on a street alongside the cathedral. The rally begins across the street from the cathedral at Hyde Park.Justice Peter Garling praised both police and protesters for finding a compromise.“I would like to thank the parties and the lawyers for resolving something that arouses no doubt great passions,” Garling said before leaving the bench without making a court order.Police Acting Assistant Commissioner Martin Fileman described the street between the cathedral and the park as a “buffer zone” that reduced the risk of clashes between protesters and the thousands of mourners.“We ask that people attending on both sides tomorrow that they’re respectful of each other. And that they comply with police directions,” Fileman told reporters outside court.Protest organizer Kim Stern was satisfied that the demonstrators could be in earshot of the cathedral congregation.“We’re now able to march up, right opposite the church and have our voices heard,” Stern told reporters.New South Wales Premier Dominic Perrottet urged all sides to behave respectfully. Perrottet, a Catholic, said he will not attend the Mass, but will be represented by a government minister.“I would say to everybody across our state today it’s a time to come together and show respect,” Perrottet told reporters.Earlier Wednesday, protesters tied ribbons in memory of victims of clergy abuse to the cathedral’s fence.Church officials had removed such ribbons in recent days, raising accusations of disrespect toward victims. But a cathedral official told protesters on Wednesday where ribbons could be placed and where they could not.Still, protesters persisted in tying ribbons near the gates through which the hearse entered the cathedral grounds, and security guards repeatedly cut them down.Pell was archbishop of Sydney from 2001 until 2014 when Pope Francis appointed him to be the first prefect of the newly created Secretariat for the Economy tasked with reforming the Vatican’s notoriously opaque finances.Pell had been archbishop of Melbourne from 1996 to 2001, the period during which he was alleged to have sexually abused two choirboys in St. Patrick’s Cathedral. He was convicted then acquitted after a second appeal.As church leader of Melbourne and later of Sydney, Pell repeatedly refused to give Communion to gay activists wearing rainbow-colored sashes.“God made Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve, and important consequences follow from this,” Pell told a St. Mary’s congregation in 2002 after he first refused Communion to a gay activist in Sydney.Pell was also a lightning rod for disagreements over whether the Catholic Church has been properly held to account for past child sex abuse.A national inquiry into institutional responses to child sex abuse found in 2017 that Pell knew of clergy molesting children in the 1970s and did not take adequate action to address it.Pell later said he was “surprised” by the inquiry's findings. “These views are not supported by evidence,” Pell’s statement said.Pell and his supporters believed he was scapegoated for all the crimes of the Australian Catholic Church’s botched response to clergy sexual abuse.He died Jan. 10 in Rome from heart complications following hip surgery.

            Richard Bloch, Melinda Gordon and Brian Keller heard the case. A decision is expected Wednesday.

            A 29-year-old right-hander, Castillo was 7-3 with a 3.64 ERA and seven saves in 59 relief appearances last year for the Mariners, who made the playoffs for the first time since 2001 and lost to eventual World Series champion Houston in the Division Series.











            Castillo struck out 53 and walked 22 in 54 1/3 innings. He had a $2.15 million salary.

            Castillo signed with the Rays in 2014 and pitched for Tampa Bay from 2018 until he was traded to Seattle in July 2021. He is 24-18 with a 3.12 ERA and 35 saves in five major league seasons, and is eligible for free agency after the 2024 World Series.

            Outfielder Teoscar Hernández, acquired by the Mariners from Toronto, also remains on track for a hearing. He asked for a raise from $10.65 million to $16 million, and Seattle offered $14 million.

            
                Angels outfielder Hunter Renfroe and Los Angeles argued the first case of the year on Monday in a decision that is being held for later announcement. He asked for a raise from $7.65 million to $11.9 million, and the Angels argued for $11.25 million.

            Twenty-four players remain scheduled for hearings, to take place through Feb. 17.

            Three players who had been scheduled to have their cases heard agreed to multiyear contracts Tuesday. New York Mets second baseman Jeff McNeil got a $50 million, four-year deal and Tampa Bay Rays infielder Yandy Díaz agreed to a $24 million, three-year contract.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796675,China's Jan factory activity contracts at slower pace amid COVID infections - Caixin PMI,"China's factory activity shrank more slowly in January after Beijing lifted tough COVID curbs late last year which helped ease pressure on manufacturers though infections among workers hampered production, a private sector survey showed on Wednesday.
The Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) nudged up to 49.2 in January from 49.0 the previous month but missed expectations in a Reuters poll of 49.5.

            The reading marks the sixth monthly contraction in a row as the 50-point index mark separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.

            The data was in contrast to a better-than-expected official survey on Tuesday, which largely focuses on big and state-owned firms, with manufacturing activity swinging back to growth. The Caixin survey centres on small firms and coastal regions, which includes a number of exporters.
Economists said the faster-than-forecast ""exit wave"" of COVID-19 infections suggests that the worst of the economic slump has passed. They expect the world's second-largest economy to rebound in the first and second quarters, although long-term issues in the property sector and weakening external demand will drag on the growth outlook.
According to the Caixin survey, the virus outbreak and subdued market conditions continued to weigh on customer demand and factory operations, with sub-indexes of both new orders and output contracting at a slower pace.
In particular, companies said staff resignations and absences due to COVID infections weighed on headcount, while insufficient staffing contributed to a renewed upturn in backlogs of work.
While a number of firms mentioned that the rollback of virus containment measures had helped to ease the strain on supply chains, logistics had yet to recover fully in some areas amid a shortage of workers.
Due to sluggish global economic growth and cooling customer demand, the sub-index of new export orders shrank for the sixth straight month in January, though less than in December.
After the government dismantled some of the world's toughest anti-virus measures in December, Chinese manufacturers expressed stronger optimism towards the 12-month outlook for output with the degree of positive sentiment in January surging to the highest since April 2021.
The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday revised China's growth outlook sharply higher for 2023, to 5.2% from 4.4% previously after ""zero-COVID"" lockdown policies in 2022 slashed China's growth rate to 3.0% - a pace below the global average for the first time in more than 40 years.China's factory activity shrank more slowly in January after Beijing lifted tough COVID curbs late last year which helped ease pressure on manufacturers though infections among workers hampered production, a private sector survey showed on Wednesday.The Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) nudged up to 49.2 in January from 49.0 the previous month but missed expectations in a Reuters poll of 49.5.The reading marks the sixth monthly contraction in a row as the 50-point index mark separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.The data was in contrast to a better-than-expected official survey on Tuesday, which largely focuses on big and state-owned firms, with manufacturing activity swinging back to growth.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796676,Fate of last ex-cop charged in Floyd murder lies with judge,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The attorney for a former Minneapolis police officer who held back bystanders while his colleagues restrained a dying George Floyd said in court filings Tuesday that his client is innocent of criminal wrongdoing and should be acquitted on state charges of aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter.

            But prosecutors argued in their filings that Tou Thao “acted without courage and displayed no compassion” despite his nearly nine years of experience and that he disregarded his training even though he could see Floyd's life slowly ebbing away.

            Tuesday was the deadline for prosecutors and defense attorneys to file final written arguments in the case of Thao, the last of the four former officers facing judgement in Floyd's killing.











            The state and federal cases against Derek Chauvin and the two other officers involved have largely been resolved, except for Chauvin's appeal of his murder conviction. But Thao asked Hennepin County Judge Peter Cahill to decide, based on stipulated evidence, whether he is guilty of aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter in Floyd’s killing, rather than going to trial.

            Floyd, a Black man, died May 25, 2020, after Chauvin, who is white, pinned him to the ground with his knee on Floyd's neck for 9 1/2 minutes. A bystander video captured Floyd’s fading cries of “I can’t breathe.” Floyd’s murder touched off protests around the world and forced a national reckoning with police brutality and racism.

            Unlike the other three former officers, Thao has maintained that he did nothing wrong. When he rejected a plea deal last August, he said “it would be lying” to plead guilty.

            Defense attorney Robert Paule argued in his written closing argument that the state has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Thao knew that Chauvin was committing a crime, nor that Thao intended to aid in a crime.

            “The death of George Floyd was a tragedy,” Paule wrote. “Yet the fact that a tragic death occurred does not transfer it into a criminal act. Thao is innocent of the charges against him because he did not intend that his specific actions were done to assist in the commission of a crime. Every one of Thao’s actions was done based upon the training he received from the Minneapolis Police Department.”

            Paule argued that Thao “reasonably believed” that Floyd was experiencing a controversial set of symptoms known as “excited delirium” and that the actions he took at the scene were with the intention of helping to get Floyd medical attention faster because he was trained to view excited delirium as life threatening. He said Thao was not aware that Floyd was not breathing or had no pulse.

            Prosecutor Matthew Frank disputed that defense, writing that even witnesses who believe excited delirium exists testified previously that Floyd displayed none of the symptoms.

            “Thao was aware that his three colleagues were on top of Floyd, and were restraining Floyd in the prone position,” Frank wrote. “Thao knew that this prone restraint was extremely dangerous because it can cause asphyxia — the inability to breathe — the exact condition from which Floyd repeatedly complained he was suffering. Yet Thao made the conscious decision to aid that dangerous restraint: He actively encouraged the other three officers, and assisted their crime by holding back concerned bystanders.” 

            Cahill has 90 days to rule on Thao's guilt. If he finds Thao guilty, he would order a presentence investigation and schedule a sentencing hearing. He'll base his decision on evidence agreed to by both sides — exhibits and transcripts from Chauvin's 2021 murder trial in state court and the federal civil rights trial of Thao, J. Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane last year. Thao was specifically convicted then of depriving Floyd of his right to medical care and of failing to intervene and stop Chauvin.

            
                Thao testified during his federal trial that he was relying on the other officers to care for Floyd’s medical needs while he served as a served as “a human traffic cone” to control the crowd and traffic outside a Minneapolis convenience store where Floyd tried to pass a counterfeit $20 bill. 

            Thao told the court that when he and Chauvin arrived, the other officers were struggling with Floyd. He said it was clear to him, as the other officers tried to put Floyd into a squad car, “that he was under the influence of some type of drugs.”

            His body camera video shows that at one point he told the onlookers, “This is why you don’t do drugs, kids.” When an off-duty, out-of-uniform Minneapolis firefighter arrived and asked if officers had checked Floyd's pulse, he ordered her, “Back off!”

            Thao acknowledged he heard onlookers becoming more anxious about Floyd’s condition and calling on officers to check his pulse. But he said his role was crowd control; there were about 15 bystanders. While he acknowledged hearing Floyd saying, “I can’t breathe,” he said he didn’t know there was anything seriously wrong with him even as an ambulance took him away.

            Cahill is already familiar with much of the evidence, having presided over Chauvin's trial. But the evidence in this case will also include details from the federal trial about Thao's training and work history, as well as his interview with investigators from the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension.

            Thao, Kueng and Lane got federal sentences ranging from 3 1/2 years for Thao to 2 1/2 years for Lane and are serving their time in prisons in otherstates, as is Chauvin, who pleaded guilty to a federal civil rights charge and is serving a 21-year sentence that will keep him in prison longer than the 22 1/2-year sentence Cahill gave him on the state second-degree murder charge because he would qualify for parole earlier in the state system..

            Thao is Hmong American, Kueng is Black and Lane is white.

            If Thao is convicted of aiding and abetting manslaughter, a more serious murder count with a presumptive sentence of 12 1/2 years will be dropped. Minnesota guidelines recommend four years on the manslaughter count. He would serve his state term concurrent with his federal sentence.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796678,Michigan moves for early slot for 2024 presidential primary,"LANSING, Mich. (AP) — Michigan House Democrats voted Tuesday to move the state's presidential primary to the fourth week of February and become a part of a new group of states slated to lead off the Democratic party's presidential primary starting next year. 

            The move, which was approved by the state Senate along party lines on Thursday, comes after a Democratic National Committee panel voted last month to approve a plan that would make Michigan the fifth state to hold its presidential primary in early 2024, and potentially, in years to come. 

            Democratic leaders in the state have said that the move will give Michigan an increased voice in national politics and drive more attention to the battleground state. 











            “Our population is a more reflective mix of suburban, urban and rural constituents than just about any other state that has had this early vote,” said Democratic state Sen. Jeremy Moss, the chair of the Senate's election committee. “We’re serious about putting Michigan at the forefront of presidential politics because then that puts us at the forefront of setting a national agenda.”

            House Republicans argued Tuesday that the move could cost the state party nearly all of its delegates in 2024 after the Republican National Committee set an early primary calendar that does not include Michigan. Republican state Rep. Andrew Beeler, of Port Huron, said the move would “disenfranchise” Republican voters and was ""basically spitting in the face of half of the state.”

            “There’s a 90% loss of your delegates if your primary is held before March 1. So if this becomes law, no Republican candidate for president is going to come to Michigan to campaign,” Beeler said. 

            A new presidential primary calendar that was championed by President Joe Biden would strip Iowa’s caucus of its traditional post leading off the primary and replace it with South Carolina, which would open primary voting on Feb. 3. Nevada, New Hampshire, Georgia and Michigan would follow in that order with the majority of the rest of the country holding their primaries on Super Tuesday in early March.

            As Democratic leaders in Michigan moved to match the DNC's plan, they also looked to garner Republican support for the move in hopes of receiving a two-thirds vote that was needed in the state Senate for the change to take immediate effect. 

            With the legislation passing along party lines, it now heads to Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's desk and is not scheduled to take effect until 90 days after the end of the session — leaving questions about how it will be implemented for 2024. The Legislature typically adjourns in December but would need to finish by Nov. 29 for the bill to apply to the 2024 presidential primary.

            The Democrats’ 2024 primary calendar could be moot if Biden opts to run for reelection, as expected. But no matter what happens in 2024, Moss said that the state “seized the opportunity that was presented to us” and will continue to do so to be a “key player in presidential politics.”LANSING, Mich.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796679,Oregon kidnapping suspect dies of self-inflicted gunshot,"GRANTS PASS, Ore. (AP) — The suspect in a violent kidnapping in Oregon — a man who spent little time behind bars for a similar crime in Nevada — died after shooting himself during a standoff with heavily armed police, authorities said.

            Benjamin Obadiah Foster, 36, died at a hospital Tuesday night, hours after he was taken into custody, Grants Pass Police Lt. Jeff Hattersley told KTVL TV.

            Foster had been the subject of an intensive manhunt in southwestern Oregon after a woman was found unconscious, bound and near death in a house in Grants Pass on Jan. 24. On Wednesday, she remained hospitalized in critical condition.











            In 2019, before moving to Oregon, Foster held his then-girlfriend captive inside her Las Vegas apartment for two weeks. He reached a deal with Clark County prosecutors in August 2021 that allowed him to plead guilty to one felony count of battery and a misdemeanor count of battery constituting domestic violence.

            A judge sentenced Foster to between one and 2 1/2 years in a Nevada prison. After factoring in the 729 days he had spent in jail awaiting trial, Foster could have been made to serve almost 200 additional days in state custody under the maximum sentence. Instead, he was released the day he was brought to prison, Nevada corrections department officials said on Monday.

            Grants Pass Police Chief Warren Hensman said last week that it is “extremely troubling” that Foster wound up being sought for attempted murder in Oregon instead of remaining behind bars in Nevada.

            The attack and ensuing hunt for Foster by local police, Oregon State Police and federal agents has rattled residents of Grants Pass, a town of some 40,000 in southwest Oregon. 

            Foster narrowly eluded a police raid last Thursday in the unincorporated community of Wolf Creek, Oregon, then was seen on Tuesday in the same neighborhood where the woman he was accused of attacking was found. He barricaded himself under the same house as police arrived in full force , KTVL reported.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796680,Mississippi's 1st Black woman legislator won't seek new term,"JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — The first Black woman elected to the Mississippi Legislature said Tuesday that she will not seek another term, 38 years after she first took office.

            Democratic Rep. Alyce Clarke of Jackson, 83, announced her decision one day before candidates' qualifying deadline for statewide, regional, legislative and county offices in Mississippi.

            “You can’t make a difference unless you’re at the table. And I’m glad we finally got to the table,” Clarke told The Associated Press after she made her announcement to her House colleagues.











            The first Black man to win a seat in the Mississippi Legislature in the 20th century was Robert Clark, no relation, a Democrat from Ebenezer who was elected in 1967. 

            Alyce Clarke won a March 1985 special election. Her time as the only Black woman in the Legislature was relatively short, since in 1987, Democrat Alice Harden of Jackson won a seat in the state Senate.

            Several other Black women have since been elected to Mississippi's 122-member House and 52-member Senate, but women generally remain a small minority in both chambers.

            Only three white women were House members when Clarke arrived. The men had a restroom near the House chamber on the Capitol's third floor, but the women had to go to restrooms on another floor — an inconvenience that prevented them from sneaking out during long debates.

            Clarke said that early in her legislative career, she saw a House staff member slip a key to one of her white female colleagues for a private women's restroom on the second floor. Clarke had been going all the way down to a public restroom on the first floor.

            “Stupid me,"" Clarke recalled Tuesday. “I said, ‘It’s never been locked when I was in there.’ And then I saw the other two ladies look at each other kind of strange. I said, ‘Something’s not quite right about this.’”

            She said she went home and told her husband: “'The white ladies have a bathroom.’”

            Her husband urged her to call reporters. She did, and the snub of the only Black female legislator made headlines.

            Clarke said when she arrived at the Capitol the next day, a security officer gave her a key to the private restroom and told her she was being summoned to see then-House Speaker C.B. “Buddie” Newman, a Democrat.

            Clarke said Newman — who apparently hadn't read the newspapers — told her that if she promised not to tell the media about the restroom situation, he would get a committee to work on putting a new women's restroom near the House chamber.

            “I said, ‘I promise you I won’t tell them because I told them last night,'” Clarke said.

            Within a relatively short time, female lawmakers had the same ease of access to a restroom as their male colleagues, with the women's room installed in a space formerly used for the men's shoeshine stand. 

            Potty parity aside, Clarke said Tuesday that women have made a difference in the legislative process.

            “If you happen to be in the committee, quite often there are things you think of that they don’t think of,” she said. “And it appears that we are really more concerned about educating our children and making sure they don’t end up in prison.”

            Democratic Rep. Ed Blackmon — who for many years shared a two-person desk with Clarke in the House chamber — said Tuesday that Clarke accomplished goals by being persistent.

            “She bothers you — I’ll put it that way,"" Blackmon said with a chuckle. ""But she’s real nice in the way she bothers you.”

            Clarke pushed early in her legislative career to establish Born Free, a drug and alcohol treatment center for pregnant women. She said she had seen a need for the program while working in a nutrition program at a public health center.

            In the 1990s, she led an effort to establish Mississippi’s first drug courts, which provide supervision, drug testing and treatment services to help keep some people out of prison.

            She was also instrumental in persuading her colleagues to establish a state lottery. Clarke filed lottery bills for 19 years before legislators voted in 2018 to create a lottery to help pay for highways. Recognizing her persistence, the House and Senate voted to name the legislation the Alyce G. Clarke Mississippi Lottery Law. When lottery tickets went on sale in 2019, Clarke bought the ceremonial first ticket at a Jackson convenience store.

            The current House speaker, Republican Philip Gunn, said Tuesday that Clarke has served with class and dignity.

            “You have made the state of Mississippi proud,"" he told Clarke, and her colleagues applauded.JACKSON, Miss.

            Of the 34 People’s Liberation Army (PLA) aircraft, 20 were tracked in Taiwan’s air defense identification zone (ADIZ), according to the MND. Two Sukhoi Su-30 fighter jets were monitored in the northeast sector, while two Shaanxi Y-8 electronic intelligence planes, one Harbin BZK-005 reconnaissance drone, one BZK-007 reconnaissance drone, one Shaanxi Y-8 electronic warfare plane, and one Shaanxi Y-8 anti-submarine warfare plane entered the southwest corner of the ADIZ.

            Meanwhile, six Shenyang J-16 fighter planes either entered the southwest corner of the ADIZ or crossed the Taiwan Strait median line. In addition, four Chengdu J-10 jet fighters and two Shenyang J-11 fighter jets also crossed the median line.

            In response, Taiwan sent aircraft, naval ships, and used land-based missiles to monitor PLA aircraft and vessels.











            Since September 2020, China has increased its use of gray zone tactics by routinely sending aircraft into Taiwan’s ADIZ. Gray zone tactics are defined as “an effort or series of efforts beyond steady-state deterrence and assurance that attempts to achieve one’s security objectives without resort to direct and sizable use of force.”

            The review will include two 15-year-old shootings by Oakland Officer Hector Jimenez. In July 2008, Jimenez killed 27-year-old Mack “Jody” Woodfox, who was shot in the back while running away from a traffic stop.











            Seven months earlier, Jimenez and another officer shot and killed Andrew Moppin-Buckskin, 20, who also ran away after a traffic stop.

            In both cases, Jimenez told investigators that he believed the suspects were reaching for guns in their waistbands.

            Former District Attorney Nancy O’Malley reviewed both cases and found the officers involved couldn't be charged with criminal wrongdoing.

            Jiminez was fired in 2009 for violating Oakland police use-of-force policies but he was reinstated after an arbitrator found the shooting was lawful, said Michael Rains, the attorney whose firm represented Jimenez during the arbitration process.

            Rains told the San Francisco Chronicle he was skeptical that the re-examination of the Woodfox case would find “proof beyond a reasonable doubt” that the shooting wasn't justified. 

            The decision to re-examine both killings was “ridiculous,” Sgt. Barry Donelan, president of the Oakland Police Officers association, told the paper.

            “These cases have been investigated from every angle inside and out by multiple agencies, both criminally and administratively, and the officers have been cleared,” Donelan said. “For the last decade and a half, this officer has continued to work on the job protecting the residents of Oakland valiantly.""

            The former district attorney also declined to charge Alameda officers involved in the April 2021 custody death of Mario Gonzalez. The Oakland resident died after the officers tried to arrest him on suspicion of shoplifting at a park and pinned him to the ground for several minutes. 

            The county coroner ruled his death a homicide, concluding that Gonzalez had a heart attack caused by methamphetamine use and from being restrained by officers.

            An investigation commissioned by the city last year found the officers didn't violate Police Department policy.

            The DA’s Public Accountability Unit will review that death, the 2021 death of Vinetta Martin in Santa Rita Jail, which was classified as a suicide, and the fatal shootings of Cody Chavez by Pleasanton police in 2022; Caleb Smith by Hayward officers in 2021; Joshua Gloria by Fremont officers in 2021 and Agustin Gonsalez by Hayward police in 2019.

            Price was elected as district attorney in November on a reform platform. At a Sunday rally to protest the death of Tyre Nichols by Memphis police officers, Price told the crowd: “I refuse to be complicit in murder, in racialized justice, in a failed system that does not respond to people suffering with mental health crises.""OAKLAND, Calif.
