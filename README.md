2. cleaning.py : class for cleaning dataset
3. display_plot : class for plot word cloud, frequency distribution
4. model_clustering : class for clustering algorithm
5. route.py : main function
6. run.py
7. vectorizer.py : class for vectorizer algorithm

To run in your local computer you need to install flask and some libraries that are used in this project. I use virtual environment to run this code.
